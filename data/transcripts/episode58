OFFICE LADIES | EPISODE 58 - DUNDER MIFFLIN INFINITY PART 1

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:04] I'm Jenna Fischer.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:05] And I'm Angela Kinsey.



JENNA FISCHER [00:00:06] We were on "The Office" together.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:07] And we're best friends.



JENNA FISCHER [00:00:08] And now we're doing the ultimate "Office" rewatch podcast just for you.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:12] Each week we will break down an episode of "The Office" and give exclusive behind-the-scenes stories that only two people who were there can tell you.



JENNA FISCHER [00:00:19] We're the "Office Ladies". Hello, Pam Sass.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:25] I'm wearing my Pam Sass shirt and I'm loving it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:00:29] It is so stinking cute! I can't wait to get mine.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:34] They're really cute. And I, they're a conversation starter because I parked in the parking lot here at Earwolf. And as I was walking in a guy, by the way, it was 10:50 am. A guy had a cocktail in his hand and said, "What party are you going to"?



JENNA FISCHER [00:00:54] OK.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:55] And I was like, he was in fluorescent yellow shorts with a white t shirt, and I was like, "I'm what? Is it because of my, is it because of my Pam Sass shirt you think I'm going to a party"?



JENNA FISCHER [00:01:06] I'm pretty sure it had absolutely nothing to do with your shirt that you could have been dressed in literally anything. This is 100 percent about him and his shorts and his cocktail before 11:00.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:19] Yeah, well, he's liv-, he's, he's doing it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:01:24] All right. Today is "Dunder Mifflin Infinity: Part One". This is Season 4, Episode 3. This is another one of our one hour shows that was meant to kick off Season 4, we're dividing it into two parts. This episode was written by Michael Schur and it was directed by Craig Zisk.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:44] Yes. All right, Jenna, you're up. It's summary time.



JENNA FISCHER [00:01:47] Here is a summary of what we are covering today. "When Ryan tries to implement new ideas like issuing everyone a BlackBerry and announcing the new Dunder Mifflin Infinity website, Michael feels he may be a victim of ageism. Jim and Pam's relationship goes public, and they are now forced to face the scrutiny of the entire staff. Meanwhile, Angela is going to give Dwight one more chance after his mercy killing of Sprinkles".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:02:17] Yup.



JENNA FISCHER [00:02:19] All right. Fast Fact Number One, like I said, this episode was directed by Craig Zisk. He had been an executive producer on "Weeds", "The United States of Tara" and "The Larry Sanders Show" and more recently, "Brooklyn Nine-Nine". He's directed a ton of television. He directed a bunch of episodes of "Scrubs" and movies. Do you remember Craig?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:02:40] I do remember Craig. And actually, when Craig came to direct, we had a little thing in common, which is I had worked with his brother, Randy Zisk, who's also a producer and director, and he had directed me on my episode of "Monk". So when I saw Craig, we had, we sort of like had this moment. He was like, "Hey, you were on my brother's show". And I was like, "Yes, how are you"?



JENNA FISCHER [00:03:01] Well, I had a little thing not in common with Craig, but in adoration of him, because when he was 25 years old, he was one of the producers of the television show "Cop Rock". Do you remember "Cop Rock", Angela?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:03:21] No, I've never heard of it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:03:24] Oh, my God.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:03:27] What?



JENNA FISCHER [00:03:27] Oh, my God, OK. It came out in 1990.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:03:30] OK.



JENNA FISCHER [00:03:30] It was on ABC. It was, brace yourself, a musical comedy drama show about the LAPD.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:03:41] Oh, my gosh, there's so much happening.



JENNA FISCHER [00:03:44] OK, it was created by Steven Bochco, who had also created the very famous "Hill Street Blues" and basically, Angela, it was a cop show like maybe imagine "Law and Order", if all of a sudden in the middle of the episode, they break into song.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:03] No.



JENNA FISCHER [00:04:04] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:04] No.



JENNA FISCHER [00:04:04] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:05] I can't, I can't do it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:04:07] Here is an audio clip from an episode.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:11] Oh God.



JENNA FISCHER [00:04:11] You know, when they all gather in the room and like the lieutenant is like, "Here's what's on the docket today".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:16] Yeah. Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:04:16] "We got this happening and this happening".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:18] Yeah. Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:04:19] OK, that's what he's doing at the top of the scene. Sam, will you play the clip?



COP ROCK CLIP [00:04:24] I had him last on the teletype. We still got the Franklin Avenue flashers. OK, that's it. And hey. Hey. Let's be careful out there. Let's be careful out there. We had a 187 at the 7-Eleven on the corner of 4th and Main.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:00] No, they did not.



JENNA FISCHER [00:05:00] They did.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:00] No, they didn't.



JENNA FISCHER [00:05:03] It was canceled after 11 episodes.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:06] Oh, why?



JENNA FISCHER [00:05:08] TV guide ranked it number eight on its list of the "50 Worst TV Shows of All Time" in 2002.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:15] Wow. Wow.



JENNA FISCHER [00:05:16] But it actually won two Emmy Awards for Editing and Outstanding Achievement in Music and Lyrics. I want you to know, I loved this show. I watched every episode.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:27] This is all we need to know about you, Jenna.



JENNA FISCHER [00:05:30] It was like "Glee", but a cop show. It was brilliant. You can find it on YouTube.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:35] It sounds like an SNL parody of like a cop show or something. That is amazing. I now have to go see just one. I mean.



JENNA FISCHER [00:05:43] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:43] I mean, I have to see what were there like, "We got the perp in the cell. We're gonna frisk him now".



JENNA FISCHER [00:05:51] I think that's a song.  I think there's-.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:53] "I got the perp, frisk him up".



JENNA FISCHER [00:05:56] Ooh, "frisk him up". That's a good one.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:01] "Frisk him up".



JENNA FISCHER [00:06:01] "Frisk him up, frisk him up. Frisk him up, frisk him down. What did you find? Is there a gun? Is there a knife? You gotta frisk him up!".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:07] "Or are you just happy to see me"?



JENNA FISCHER [00:06:13] This show really writes itself.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:14] Oh my gosh. Wow.



JENNA FISCHER [00:06:17] All right.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:17] "I want you to be safe out there". "You heard him, be safe, out there. Be safe".



JENNA FISCHER [00:06:24] This is, this is now like a hybrid "West Side Story", "Cop Rock".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:28] That's all I can picture in my mind. Oh my lord. OK, that's amazing. And Craig worked on it?



JENNA FISCHER [00:06:33] He was one of the producers. Well, I'll bring us back with Fast Fact Number Two.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:39] OK.



JENNA FISCHER [00:06:40] This episode, "Dunder Mifflin Infinity", aired in October of 2007.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:47] Mmhmm.



JENNA FISCHER [00:06:48] And also in October 2007, was a big "Office" Convention in Scranton, Pennsylvania.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:54] Yes. And a whole bunch of us went, a huge group. I mean, it was like Greg went and Mike Schur and Jen Celotta, a bunch of the writers and the cast, I think the whole entire cast was there, except for you and Steve, right? And John. Everyone else went, like the whole shebang.



JENNA FISCHER [00:07:13] I was not allowed to go because remember, I shared last week about how I broke my back.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:07:19] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:07:20] And I was not cleared for plane travel at this time.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:07:23] I was, I was super sad you weren't there. I found some emails where we traded emails. You were like, "Please tell everyone I said 'Hi'". But it was a absolute blast. Scranton was so much fun. Scranton! Everyone there was great. And then me and Craig and Brian went on "The Today Show" with Al Roker. Al Roker came to Scranton and we did "The Today Show" from there with him. And it, I mean, it was just a blast.



JENNA FISCHER [00:07:51] I was so jealous. That looked like so much fun. You guys did like a whole Q&A panel and like a Meet and Greet. Right?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:07:59] And we did like a concert, like there was a concert and a bunch of people from "The Office" performed like Craig and Melora and like everyone got up on stage. It was so much fun. But, you know, lady, this, this was something you and I both share because I was able to go to this Convention. But then at the end of the show, there was another one, like a big wrap party Convention, and it was my daughter's birthday. So you went to that one. So I found all these emails, Jenna, where we sort of bookend this experience for each other because I went to one and you got to go to the other.



JENNA FISCHER [00:08:31] Yeah, I remember that. I was so glad I got to go to that one at the end of the show.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:08:37] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:08:38] Because I couldn't, I couldn't, like, leave the experience of "The Office", having never visited Scranton. So I just remember I was really jealous that you got to go and I was bummed that I had to stay home. But, you know.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:08:49] Well, you know, we've never gotten to go together, and that's on my bucket list.



JENNA FISCHER [00:08:55] Oh yes.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:08:55] When this podcast is done, I want you and I to go to Scranton. That's on my wish list.



JENNA FISCHER [00:09:01] I want you and I to go to Scranton and just anonymously sign up for "The Office" tour.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:07] Oh, my gosh! Yes!



JENNA FISCHER [00:09:08] And just show up and be like, "Take us on the tour".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:12] Yes. Yes. To all the spots. I want to do it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:09:14] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:15] Well, listen, there was something else going on during this time. I don't know if you remember, but we were on the cover of Entertainment Weekly magazine.



JENNA FISCHER [00:09:25] We were?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:26] It came out October 5th, which was the day after this episode aired. And there were a few sets of couples, Steve and Melora, as Jan and Michael were on one cover, and then Angela and Dwight were on one, and Jim and Pam, and then Ryan and Kelly. So you could pick which issue had the cover. But then we were all on the inside in this big group photo.



JENNA FISCHER [00:09:49] I remember doing that photo shoot.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:51] I know.



JENNA FISCHER [00:09:51] It was so fun.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:53] It was such a, such a cool day and I couldn't believe it. Like I had always, you know, picked up Entertainment Weekly, I loved television, it was like my dream to be on TV and then to all of a sudden be on the cover and be in it with you guys, I couldn't even believe it. I have one framed.



JENNA FISCHER [00:10:08] Well, this is what was happening at this time, which was that the show was truly blowing up and we were on covers of magazines and it was so surreal. Early on, I tried to save every single mention of us or the show from any publication because I, it just felt so fleeting. And then at this time it became, it became impossible. It was just constant. And we were really out in the zeitgeist. Is that the right word?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:10:40] Yeah. Yeah. No, the show was just really catching on. I'll tell you what, between my mom and my grandmother and my cousin, Carol, and my Aunt Brenda, I think I have everything we were ever mentioned in because they saved everything and they would send it to me.



JENNA FISCHER [00:10:54] Well, speaking of being out in the world in a big way, Fast Fact Number Three. We got a lot of fan mail from people about the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website. And they wanted to know if it was real. Well, it was real and it went out into the world around this exact same time as this episode.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:11:18] That is right. And we reached out to Joya Balfour. Joya, as you remember, Jenna was part of the team at NBC.com. And you guys networks were not doing digital content during this time. It's just something they didn't do. So NBC was really on the forefront. And I talked to Joya and she was saying they were trying to find ways to sustain the fandom, to keep fans engaged. And one of the things they did was they launched DunderMifflinInfinity.com. You could go on and play these games. There were virtual branches that fans could join. They could perform tasks that, where they would earn Schrute Bucks and then they could spend their Schrute Bucks on virtual items in sort of like "The Office". And they went around to all of our desks. They took pictures of the set so that they could actually buy virtual items. And this site ran for three years on NBC.com and fans got signed items from the show. And also if they submitted their artwork, it would be displayed in episodes. Jenna, fan art was put around the set. So your art might make it into the show. It might end up on the refrigerator in the kitchen or on a bulletin board like by Creed and Meredith. And fans could look for their art if they won. Isn't that amazing? It's really incredible, because I just want to remind everyone there was no Instagram. There were no apps back then. Like this was really, really revolutionary in terms of that idea of fan engagement and getting to participate in some way actively with your favorite show.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:12:51] Yes. And they even made a video and actually I have audio of it. Sam, can you play the video of DunderMifflinInfinity.com?



DUNDERMIFFLININFINITY.COM [00:13:00] Do you like paper? Well, we like you. Dunder Mifflin is looking for bright, energetic paper people to open up their own branch and become part of the Dunder Mifflin family. Interested in your own future? Go to DunderMifflinInfinity.com to find out more.



JENNA FISCHER [00:13:20] I love it.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:13:21] Isn't that great? And I asked Joya who did that voice over and she said, that's just a voiceover actor that they hired. She has a whole page on her website, JoyaBalfour.com, where you can look at Dunder Mifflin Infinity and what all they did with it. You can actually watch that video that we just played for you. And I told Joya over the next few episodes, the next few seasons, I'm going to reach out to her, kind of like your Kentapedia, because I really started becoming a more active participant on NBC.com. I did a thing called "Adventures with Angela". We had "The Accountants" webisodes. There were a lot more fun things we started to do and I'm going to hit her up along the way.



JENNA FISCHER [00:13:56] I love that. They should relaunch this. They should relaunch Dunder Mifflin Infinity as an app.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:02] I know.



JENNA FISCHER [00:14:03] And you can do all these same things. Someone, Joya, I don't know. Who, who does this?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:10] Peacock! Get on it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:14:11] Peacock, are you listening? Do this.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:13] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:14:14] Well lady, listen, I think we should take a break. Those were incredible Fast Facts. We are killing it today. I'm giving us compliments. But let's take a break and then we'll come back and, and get into this episode.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:28] OK, great. Because I've got more details, lady.



JENNA FISCHER [00:14:31] More details.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:32] I know I'm not Kentapedia, but maybe I'm Kinseypedia on this one.



JENNA FISCHER [00:14:37] Kinseypedia after the break.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:39] Kinseypedia.



JENNA FISCHER [00:14:43] All right, we are back and we open this episode in the break room where there is no more heartbreak. In fact, there is flirty flirt cuteness in there.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:53] In fact, I'm pretty sure it's now called the flirt room.



JENNA FISCHER [00:14:56] I think you're right, Jim and Pam. Pam has already gotten Jim a soda.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:02] Mmhmm.



JENNA FISCHER [00:15:02] Mmm, because she knows what he likes because she's his girlfriend.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:05] Then she gives him a little peck, little kiss as she's leaving.



JENNA FISCHER [00:15:10] But Toby sees.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:10] Can we talk about Paul's expression?



JENNA FISCHER [00:15:15] We can.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:15] I froze on his face. I was laughing so hard. It's, I don't even know what all it's conveying. It's conveying so many things. At 20 seconds, Toby's face.



JENNA FISCHER [00:15:25] Well, Paul does some amazing reaction acting in this episode. If you are an actor and you would like to study great reactions, this is a real good one to study.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:37] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:15:37] Well, what happens after this is that Toby puts out a memo regarding PDA in the workplace and everyone's reading it. And Jim and Pam are like, "What is this about"?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:50] Toby is so passive aggressive.



JENNA FISCHER [00:15:52] He really is.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:53] He clearly has issue, but he's going to put out a memo? Come on, Toby.



JENNA FISCHER [00:15:58] Well, Michael thinks that the memo is about that night that he and Jan did some stuff in his office. But I mean, he says almost everyone was gone for the day. This is ridiculous, Toby.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:16:11] Yeah. And then Angela thinks it might be about her and Dwight. So she yells from across the room and makes this big statement that she's never been intimate with anyone in the office.



JENNA FISCHER [00:16:22] And that is when Toby says, "No, no, it was a complaint about Jim and Pam", and then he basically outs their relationship to the whole office.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:16:35] I mean, Toby, this is twice now because he did this was Oscar.



JENNA FISCHER [00:16:40] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:16:40] And now with Jim and Pam, he's announced that they're dating and everyone freaks out. But no one, no one freaks out more than Michael.



JENNA FISCHER [00:16:48] Well, Michael is giddy, Michael doesn't even know what to do with himself. And Steve's performance is so sweet. He is so genuinely excited that Jim and Pam are together he makes them hold hands and he makes a big declaration, "This day will go down in infamy".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:08] He makes you guys hold hands and then he really bear hugs Jim, and then he goes to hug you, but your phone starts ringing and Pam is like, "Oh!", like rescued by my phone. And he's like, "No, no, Pam, let it ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love".



JENNA FISCHER [00:17:27] But then he has that really famous line that I've seen people write on their graduation hats.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:33] I've seen it everywhere. I've seen it like stitched on a pillow, on a graduation hat. It's, it's so good.



JENNA FISCHER [00:17:40] Say it, Ang.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:41] "My heart soars with the eagle's nest.



JENNA FISCHER [00:17:44] Incredible. Now, we said this episode was written by Mike Schur, and that has to be a Mike Schur special right there.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:49] It has to be. Now we see a series of talking heads and Jenna, I was very curious about this because you like to deep dive on positioning. Ooh, that sounds like a "That's what she said".



JENNA FISCHER [00:18:00] That sounded different than what I think you mean, but go on.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:07] As it was coming out of my mouth, I knew it was wrong. That's what she said.



JENNA FISCHER [00:18:11] That's what she said.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:13] So Dwight's talking head, he's like, "I don't see it. I think they could do better". He is sitting in front of the wall and off of his left shoulder. Is the bullpen. Right?



JENNA FISCHER [00:18:23] Yep. Yep.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:24] Then it cuts to me and I say, "I'm not surprised. Pam is the office mattress".



JENNA FISCHER [00:18:30] Yep.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:30] Which is such a great line. But I'm sitting in front of the window with the wall to my right shoulder.



JENNA FISCHER [00:18:38] Yeah, there's more wall and more window depending on who's talking head it is. It's not always the exact same shot. I noticed that too.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:47] And then it cuts to Andy and he's framed the exact same way that Dwight was. And I'm, I realize I'm becoming one of the fans of the show where I'm like, "Mmmm, is there something there"? But I'm like, this is an interesting love triangle that's about to play out. And this is a little bit of a Dwight Angela Andy sandwich.



JENNA FISCHER [00:19:07] I don't think you are reading into it. I noticed the same thing. I feel like they purposely didn't set all the shots the same. And they also differentiated Angela from the two men.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:18] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:19:19] That can't be an accident.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:20] It can't be. All right. Well, now we're going to get into the episode, right? We have our opening credits. And the first scene is the Party Planning Committee. They're setting up for Ryan's return. Phyllis and Angela are hanging a banner that says, "Welcome back, Ryan". 3 minutes, 28 seconds, skin alert.



JENNA FISCHER [00:19:38] What's a skin alert?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:39] Well, my sweater in this episode, I feel like the dry clean shrunk it. Like it fit one day and then the next day it got a little tighter. And as I'm hanging the banner, you see like my midriff.



JENNA FISCHER [00:19:51] Oh my gosh, that's very out of character for Angela Martin.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:53] It's very scandalous. It's scandalous.



JENNA FISCHER [00:19:56] Well, double skin alert. Kelly arrives.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:00] Mmhmm.



JENNA FISCHER [00:20:00] She is all zhushed up. She's like, "Oh, is Ryan coming back today? I had no idea". She looks super cutie pie.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:08] She looks super cutie pie. We also, in this scene, have a list of "That's what she saids" that Michael had ready to go.



JENNA FISCHER [00:20:15] Oh, please, please read it.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:17] Here it is. "Can you make that straighter"? "That job looks hard". "You should put your mouth on that". "You might want to trim it a little".



JENNA FISCHER [00:20:27] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:27] Mmhmm. Mmhmm.



JENNA FISCHER [00:20:30] I liked it when he said, "You might want to put your mouth on that" and Pam says, "How? I don't understand how you were even planning to use that naturally".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:39] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:20:39] And he was like, under his breath, he's like, "If you, if you were blowing up balloons".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:43] I was just, I, I don't know.



JENNA FISCHER [00:20:45] Just balloons.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:46] I had it ready. I was ready to go.



JENNA FISCHER [00:20:47] Well, now we have sort of an interesting little spy shot. We've got some black and white footage of the elevator bay, which is meant to be, I guess, security camera footage.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:00] Yeah, but they, this is like something we don't do on the show. So it was jarring to me when I saw it again, because I hadn't seen this episode in so long and I was like, whoa, what's up with the security camera footage?



JENNA FISCHER [00:21:11] Well, what was odd is that we then switch to a spy shot from our regular documentary camera.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:18] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:21:19] So it was a little bit, I, I found it a little bit odd as well, but that's what that black and white footage is supposed to be. And the reason they're showing this is because Dwight and Angela have met in this elevator vestibule so that he can present her with a new cat, a feral barn cat.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:37] Feral?



JENNA FISCHER [00:21:39] Feral?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:39] How do you save feral?



JENNA FISCHER [00:21:41] Feral, feral.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:43] You say-.



JENNA FISCHER [00:21:43] Tomato, tomato?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:44] You say feral?



JENNA FISCHER [00:21:45] Feral.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:45] A feral cat.



JENNA FISCHER [00:21:48] A feral cat. Feral feral.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:51] Its feral, right?



JENNA FISCHER [00:21:52] It's tomato, tomato.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:54] Sam?



SAM KIEFFER [00:21:54] Feral.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:55] Ah, Sam sided with me! And Dwight says "feral" in the episode. But anyway, Jenna, we'll just, we'll just chunk that aside and let you say "feral".



JENNA FISCHER [00:22:09] Listeners, do any of you say "feral"? Please write us.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:14] All right. So, yes, Dwight gives her Garbage and this poor cat, they put, like, stuff in its hair to make it look kind of grungy like it had been eating garbage.



JENNA FISCHER [00:22:25] Well, we had a fan question from Riv Kawasserman, "Did they gel the cat's hair before the shoot to make him look like more of a stray cat"? Well, I reached out to Kim Ferry and she said they did. That her memory is that the trainer had a little bit of honey. We had warned the trainer of this very well trained, domesticated cat that we wanted it to look feral. And so they suggested something natural, like honey, to kind of rough up the cat's fur. And so that's what they used.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:58] Yes. These trainers were so great with the cats. And obviously, honey isn't going to do anything, you know, that's just like organic. I do have amazing memories of this scene. I want you guys to know that this cat was crawling all over Rainn, all over him.



JENNA FISCHER [00:23:15] Well, you can see it in the episode. Like every shot, the cat is in a different position.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:20] It kept jumping out of his arms. And so we really had to sort of deliver the emotion of the scene, but get our lines out quickly because this thing was climbing off Rainn and wanted to go exploring. The whole scene.



JENNA FISCHER [00:23:36] Well, my favorite is the shot where it's like clearly crawling over his shoulder. And then one second later, he's holding it like a baby.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:44] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:23:45] In his arms.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:46] Because.-



JENNA FISCHER [00:23:46] That's amazing. Clearly the cat was everywhere.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:48] The cat was everywhere. And the cat wranglers were like stepping in and being like, "OK, here, try holding him this way. Try this". When the cat jumps out of Rainn's arms at the end.



JENNA FISCHER [00:23:58] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:58] That was like the easiest moment to film because it wanted, it wanted to go explore.



JENNA FISCHER [00:24:03] Well, Ang, a lot of people asked if this was the same cat that Andy gives you later that becomes Bandit. I mean, it's, I wouldn't think it was meant to be the same cat. Like, I think what they're thinking is, oh, Dwight lets this cat go. And then years later, Andy finds it again and calls it Bandit?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:24:24] Well, that would be hilarious, but that was never conveyed to us in the script. It's just that Andy wants to give Angela a cat. What I found interesting about that. And obviously we're going to get to that episode is that Angela accepts the cat from Andy, right?



JENNA FISCHER [00:24:38] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:24:38] But does not accept the cat from Dwight. And does it right in front of Dwight to sort of, you know, just really drive the point home that he's not, he's not her fella anymore.



JENNA FISCHER [00:24:48] Well, as a person who worked in Animal Rescue for years and years, I will tell you that I don't recommend giving pets as gifts because so many of the pets that are surrendered were gifts. That people were not prepared to take care of in the long run or they break up or whatever happens. I just think people should pick their own pets. Or really what my mom always said is let the pet pick you. That's how you get your match.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:25:18] Yeah, I like that. I definitely feel our pets picked us, for sure.



JENNA FISCHER [00:25:23] Yeah, that's how we got Sunny. We went into this rescue center because we were told that one of the volunteers was going to bring in this box of fluffy gray and white cats. They were so cute. They had sent us pictures. My daughter was all excited and we got there and the woman was running late. So they took us into a room with all of these adoptable cats and kittens. And this one little scrappy orange fellow would not leave us alone. I always say it was like he walked up to us and he was like, "Hey, guys, what's up? Good to see you. My name's Sunny, I'll be coming home with you. You can take a look at these other guys if you want, but I will be your cat".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:26:02] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:26:02] And that's kind of how we got Sunny. He wouldn't leave us alone.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:26:05] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:26:05] And we could've never been happier.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:26:07] That was Biscuit. Biscuit just tried to hide in my sweatshirt and I thought, "Well, you got to come home with me now".



JENNA FISCHER [00:26:11] Exactly.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:26:12] My sweatshirt is your home.



JENNA FISCHER [00:26:14] Well, listen, switching gears back to the show.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:26:17] Yeah. Don't get us started on our, on our rescue pets. It'd be a huge tangent.



JENNA FISCHER [00:26:22] Pam and Jim are going to go to Toby and offer to sign one of the famous love documents.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:26:30] Yes. The relationship disclosure form. And Toby is like, "You know what? That's only for people who are serious". And he's sort of implying, "This isn't serious. Right"? Because, you know, Toby has his big crush on Pam. And so he's hoping this is casual. But Jenna, there's a great scene in the bloopers, where at the end of the scene, Toby just tries to hold Pam's hand in front of Jim and you guys couldn't get through it. You just start laughing.



JENNA FISCHER [00:26:56] I remember trying to shoot that. I don't think we ever got it and that's why we never included it. But it was also just something we thought was so funny in the moment. It was like an improvisation that, that Toby would slowly try to hold Pam's hand during this scene and squeeze her hand.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:27:12] Yeah. And Jim's like, "What's happening"?



JENNA FISCHER [00:27:17] Well, then Ryan returns.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:27:21] Yes. Ryan, with his new look and his love of BlackBerries, walks in.



JENNA FISCHER [00:27:27] Oh, my God. BJ's performance is so good. When he's absorbed in his phone and Pam's like, "Hey, Ryan. Wha-", and he's like, "One second". And then like after he's done typing, he puts it down and he's like, "Hey, Pam, how's it going"? It was so good.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:27:45] Well, you know, in this scene, I know what you guys are all really here to find out about is a sad plant alert.



JENNA FISCHER [00:27:51] Oh, no.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:27:53] 6 minutes, 7 seconds. Sad plant. I think, Pam, now, for sure, the plants aren't going to have a chance because she's in love.



JENNA FISCHER [00:28:01] Yeah, she doesn't have time for that.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:03] It's the tiniest little like two like green leaves sticking out of the pot. It's like so tiny.



JENNA FISCHER [00:28:09] Well, the thing that I remember about this scene, Angela, is when the character of Kevin runs up to Ryan and like ruffles his hair.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:18] He gives him a noogie. He like puts him in a headlock and gives him a noogie.



JENNA FISCHER [00:28:21] Those guys could not get through that moment. Every time it would make BJ laugh. B.J. thought it was so funny and he would break. And I remember we couldn't get through it.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:32] And Brian too. I loved it when, when he's like, "Fire guy". And then Andy comes over and he's like "Fire guy" and Brian as Kevin is like, "You weren't here for that".



JENNA FISCHER [00:28:41] I know. And then, and then Andy says, "Here for what"?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:45] Yeah. It's so good.



JENNA FISCHER [00:28:47] It's so good. Well, we had a fan question from Lauren C. She wanted to know about Ryan's new look. You know, he's got the facial stubble. He's slicked his hair back. He's wearing a fancy suit. Lauren wants to know was B.J. told to grow facial hair for this season where he's the boss, or did he just personally decide to grow some? Well, I texted B.J. about this. He said this look was definitely not a personal choice. He said he thinks it was a pitch by Gene and Lee. At first the pitch was a goatee, but Greg said no. He said it was too on the nose.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:27] Yeah, a goatee was too much. The whole look was very kind of like Gordon Gekko. You know, the movie "Wall Street"?



JENNA FISCHER [00:29:33] Yes.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:33] It was like, you know, Ryan thinks he's the king of New York now.



JENNA FISCHER [00:29:37] Yes. B.J. said that he always just kind of rolled with pitches like this. And then he said, case in point, the upcoming blond hair.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:46] Oh, yeah, yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:29:49] Ryan's going to go through a few looks before this whole thing is over.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:53] Well, Ryan in this scene, though, really puts Michael in his place and everyone he's like, "Hey, you know what? Enough. This is inappropriate and it stops right now". And the whole bullpen, it's like you could hear a pin drop. We're like, "Oh, my God". And then Michael has this fantastic talking head. I just loved it so much. He's like, "Yeah, maybe, you know, maybe he spoke to me like that. But there was a twinkle in his eye and that twinkle said, 'Dude, we're friends and you know me. And I'd never take you for granted in a million years. I miss you. I love you'". And then he's like, he goes on and on, he's like, "His words, not mine".



JENNA FISCHER [00:30:31] This episode, in addition to having great facial expressions from Paul, has amazing Michael talking heads.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:30:37] They're so good.



JENNA FISCHER [00:30:39] Well, now everyone's going to meet in the conference room so that Ryan can unveil his Dunder Mifflin Infinity program.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:30:46] I have to point out something. First of all, where did the giant TV screen come from? It's not in there when the Party Planning Committee is setting up. Secondly, you might notice there's no more banner on the wall because there's a deleted scene where as they all come in. On the banner Kelly has written, she's scratched out Ryan and it says, "Welcome back, Asshole". And Michael runs up to it and quickly rips it down so Ryan won't see it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:31:17] That is amazing. Well, in this scene, Michael announces two pretty big things. Number one, all essential personnel will be receiving an office BlackBerry phone. And second, we are soon to be launching the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website that is going to streamline ordering, it's going to streamline efficiency. These are his two big announcements.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:45] Yeah. He says the company is going to get younger and sleeker and this starts a Creed storyline that is so fantastic. Creed played this so well. His reaction to the words "younger, sleeker", he starts looking around, and then he goes up to Rainn at the end and he's like, "When this, uh, new website launch"? And then he's like, "Cool beans". Like he's trying to be hip or something.



JENNA FISCHER [00:32:08] Well, he runs into Michael's office after the meeting and he's like, "You realize what this means, right? You, me, Sammy, Phyllis, the chick you hit with your car, we're all goners". Who is Sammy?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:21] Who is Sammy? Who does Creed think Sammy is?



JENNA FISCHER [00:32:26] I don't know. Did he mean Stanley?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:29] Probably. Also, he has sat across from Meredith for years and couldn't think of her name.



JENNA FISCHER [00:32:37] It's incredible. It's just great.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:40] Well, he calls my character, "Andrea, the office bitch". So Sammy is probably Stanley. So now we have a very cute scene back in the flirt room.



JENNA FISCHER [00:32:50] Mmhmm.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:50] The flirt room break room. Jim and Pam are eating lunch together and Jim's like, "I can't believe I didn't tell you this. This is going to blow your mind". And he tells Pam that Dwight and Angela are dating. And Pam's like, "Um, yeah, I already knew that. It's been like a long time".



JENNA FISCHER [00:33:08] Since before your barbecue, she says.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:10] Yeah. And then, I love this. This next moment is just titled "Phyllis Sass". Phyllis walks in and says, "Sorry, I didn't know you guys were in here". And Jim says, "Oh, we're, we're just sitting here". And Phyllis goes, "Couldn't see your hands". What? What is she implying? First of all, she knew they were in there, OK? So she knew they were in there. She went to find Pam to tell her this information. Secondly, couldn't see your hands?



JENNA FISCHER [00:33:40] Well, and then John does this awesome move with his hands, where he shows them to camera like-.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:46] What?



JENNA FISCHER [00:33:47] They're so clearly right here. I loved that moment. That was a Krasinski special right there.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:51] No, it was perfect. And then Phyllis with the smile, sass with a smile, is like, "You know, I'm glad you guys are dating. But Pam, when we get a new client, you have to just send it to, you know, the first available salesperson, not whoever you're sleeping with that week". That week! That week. It's like Phyllis and Angela both are in cahoots this episode because Pam is "the office mattress".



JENNA FISCHER [00:34:17] Well, Angela, I'm calling this a Fan Sass Catch from Senia G., she points out the major Phyllis Sass as well, but she added this, "According to Phyllis, Pam is in charge of assigning clients to salesmen randomly. Well, according to my husband, who's in a similar kind of office, this is a lot of power given to one person. That is not how the customers are typically assigned to salespeople. The assignment is based on the client's zip code or county to ensure that there is always a clear rule regarding this assignment". Well, I have to say, after college, before I moved to Los Angeles, I was the only receptionist, slash, administrative assistant at a small Marine Audio company in Missouri.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:10] Marine?



JENNA FISCHER [00:35:10] And. Marine Audio they made like water resistant, waterproof stereo systems for boats.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:19] Thank you. I needed clarity. Thank you.



JENNA FISCHER [00:35:22] You're welcome.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:22] OK.



JENNA FISCHER [00:35:24] Whenever we got a cold call.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:27] Mmhmm. For Marine Audio.



JENNA FISCHER [00:35:29] Right. I would just transfer them randomly to an available sales associate, it was kind of my call.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:37] Wow.



JENNA FISCHER [00:35:38] Yeah. It didn't come up very often, but every once in a while we would get a cold call.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:43] Pam's job has this weird hierarchy. First of all, she has to ask Angela for petty cash.



JENNA FISCHER [00:35:51] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:51] And then she has these sad plants and this candy that Angela expects her to put out. But now we find out she passes on clients to the sales department?



JENNA FISCHER [00:36:03] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:04] And she's Michael's secretary, it's very layered.



JENNA FISCHER [00:36:07] You know, I based a lot of my Pam stuff off of this job that I had at this Marine Audio place. It was about the same number of people as Dunder Mifflin. There was a warehouse where we shipped all the orders. And I was literally Pam. I made the coffee in the morning. I answered the phones. I did everyone's administrative work.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:31] Did you date anyone there?



JENNA FISCHER [00:36:33] I did not.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:34] Smart. Smart.



JENNA FISCHER [00:36:36] Yeah. I did not date anyone at Marine Audio.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:38] OK. Well, now we have a Jim talking head and he says, "That is why we waited so long to tell people". Did you notice Jim is facing the bullpen with his back to the outside?



JENNA FISCHER [00:36:52] No.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:53] Because his future is in the bullpen.



JENNA FISCHER [00:36:55] His future is Pam. And she's out there?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:57] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:36:58] He now has a future at Dunder Mifflin.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:00] Yes. In his heart.



JENNA FISCHER [00:37:02] It's very interesting.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:04] I know.



JENNA FISCHER [00:37:05] I want to go back one second.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:07] OK.



JENNA FISCHER [00:37:07] Just one second. I have been wondering for several episodes now out loud, when did Jim and Pam tell one another about their shared knowledge of Dwight and Angela? And it is finally revealed in this episode, it's right now at work. What? Do we believe this? This took forever.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:28] No, I believe it because I think the beginning of them falling in love and finally getting to be together, it was so special to them. I mean, I just feel like they were really absorbed with one another. And now, now they're at the point they've been dating a few months where they're like, "Oh, by the way, did you know"? You know what I mean? I think they're at that place.



JENNA FISCHER [00:37:50] Hmm.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:50] I think they were sort of in that fog of love for a few weeks. I buy it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:37:56] Hmm.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:57] You do not buy it, by your sassy "Hmm, hmm".



JENNA FISCHER [00:38:02] I think it would have been the first thing I would have said on our first dinner date.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:06] I don't think so.



JENNA FISCHER [00:38:08] "Hey, by the way".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:08] I don't think after years of loving this guy, the first time you're alone with him, it's like, "Wait, wait, wait. I'll kiss you in a second. First, we need to talk about Dwight and Angela".



JENNA FISCHER [00:38:17] You're probably right. All right. Well, now Michael and Ryan are in Michael's office. Ryan is so busy typing on his BlackBerry. Do you remember at this time? Rainn and I both had BlackBerries in real life and we were Ryan? We were constantly on our BlackBerries. We were so annoying. I think Brian Baumgartner had one too.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:38] Excuse me, I had one.



JENNA FISCHER [00:38:40] This, we all had one. That's what you had. You had a BlackBerry. There were no smartphones.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:45] You had a BlackBerry and you did not take pictures with your phone, which is why you and I have so many photos, like old timey photos, because we would bring our cameras to the set and we would take pictures and then we would go to the mall, to that kiosk and we would develop our photos.



JENNA FISCHER [00:39:03] Yep, it's true. But we could now do emails at work while we were standing between scenes because we had our BlackBerries.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:11] Yes. And our thumbs were so fast. We got so good at it. And I was a holdout. I did not get the iPhone 'til way late because I was so attached to my BlackBerry.



JENNA FISCHER [00:39:21] I was the same. I really resented the smartphone screen thing where I like pressed on the screen. I was real into the like, the tangible button thing.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:32] I kept on my phone for a long time when I finally got an iPhone. You know how you can choose the sound. So it goes click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click?



JENNA FISCHER [00:39:39] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:40] Because I was attached to the sound.



JENNA FISCHER [00:39:43] Well, Michael in this scene wants to make sure that they're on the same page, it's business as usual. And Ryan is like, "No, it's the opposite of business as usual". We're literally throwing out the old playbook. We're starting over. We want a younger, faster company. Which leads us into just an incredible talking head by Michael, just incredible.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:40:10] Yeah, he, I mean, they had a foreign exchange student that lived with him and he said we called him my brother because he was. And then he went back to what was formerly Yugoslavia and he took all of Michael's blue jeans.



JENNA FISCHER [00:40:24] Yeah, Michael had to wear shorts all winter.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:40:26] Why, Jenna, why? Why couldn't his mother buy him any replacement blue jeans for the winter?



JENNA FISCHER [00:40:33] I don't know, but we had several people write in and wonder if this is why Michael covets his blue jeans today.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:40:41] Oh my God.



JENNA FISCHER [00:40:41] And why he dry cleans them, because of this traumatic event where this foreign exchange student stole his jeans.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:40:48] And his mother punished him by not letting him buy any new ones. But yeah, he says, "That is what Ryan is like, a fake brother who steals your jeans". Well, Jenna, we should probably take a break. Before we do, I want you to know there was a deleted scene that would have happened in this area of the episode where Michael gets a message and he says to Pam, "Hey, um, can you put that in my BlackBerry? I'm too busy right now to input it. Will you put that in my BlackBerry"? And he makes a big speech. So it's like, "I am using my BlackBerry. Pam, please enter that in my BlackBerry". And then there's a Pam talking head and she goes, "Um, yeah, Michael doesn't know how to use his BlackBerry. And so when he says for me to put it in his BlackBerry, he means for me to write it on a Post-it and stick it on top of the BlackBerry". And then you see, you see his phone is covered, his BlackBerry is covered with all these little miniature Post-it note stickies.



JENNA FISCHER [00:41:44] You would love that.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:41:45] I would love that.



JENNA FISCHER [00:41:48] That's the best way to give you a message on your BlackBerry.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:41:50] I know, just put a sticky on it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:41:52] All right. Well, we'll take a break and we will be back with some Kelly Ryan drama.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:41:58] Oh, man. Kelly. Kelly's in rare form. So now we're in the annex and Kelly is telling Ryan, "You know what? I am doing great. In fact, I am dating a lot of guys". And he's like, "Kelly" and she's like "What"!? She's like, so pissed.



JENNA FISCHER [00:42:17] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:42:17] And of course, Toby, Toby is listening to the whole conversation.



JENNA FISCHER [00:42:20] Well, then Kelly says she's pregnant.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:42:26] Yeah. And then she has a talking head where she just shakes her head "no".



JENNA FISCHER [00:42:29] It made me laugh out loud. It was so funny.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:42:32] And then, and then this is how she gets Ryan to go to dinner with her. He's like, "OK". She's like, "I'm keeping the baby". And he's like, "Let's just, I can't talk about this now. Let's go to dinner". And then she has a talking head where she's like, "We have a date".



JENNA FISCHER [00:42:44] Yes. Well, also in this conversation, Ryan says, "I did take our relationship seriously. Karen asked me out six months ago and I said 'no'".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:42:56] Oh, he's such a liar. He's such a liar.



JENNA FISCHER [00:42:59] Well, this was a fan question from Hannah Calson, "Do we think Karen really asked Ryan out or was he just saying that to make Kelly jealous"?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:07] No, he was trying to show Kelly how committed he was. The truth is, he hit on Karen and asked her out and they talked about it in the bathroom in "Women's Appreciation".



JENNA FISCHER [00:43:20] That's right.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:20] It came up. Jim was like, "Yeah, she told me about that". So, no, Ryan's being a big ol' liar right here.



JENNA FISCHER [00:43:26] Well, we got a letter from Renata in Brazil about the Ryan and Kelly relationship.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:34] OK, Renata.



JENNA FISCHER [00:43:35] She was very passionate about it. And here is what she had to say.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:38] OK.



JENNA FISCHER [00:43:39] She says, "I love this episode so much, but I just need to make a comment about Kelly and Ryan's relationship and how relatable it can be and how it shouldn't be. I've met a lot of Ryans in my life and ladies, it is not worth it. I just want to send some love to all of you and say that you deserve someone who's going to put your love on top. So I hope that this crazy relationship will teach you something about what not to accept because you deserve more. I don't know. Maybe someone out there needs to hear this". That's from Renata.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:14] Renata. Applause. You're right. You're absolutely right. Another thing going on during this scene is we quickly see Phyllis and Stanley trying to figure out the BlackBerry and Jenna, if you go to 12 minutes, 41 seconds, in the deep background, you can just see me surfing the Internet. You see me like scrolling through. I jot something down, I scroll through some more. I'm probably shopping.



JENNA FISCHER [00:44:41] That's amazing. Well, then we move into Angela and Dwight having another one of their back-to-back conversations in the kitchen.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:49] Yes, but do you know who we have to thank for this moment?



JENNA FISCHER [00:44:54] Who?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:55] Pam.



JENNA FISCHER [00:44:57] Why?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:58] In a deleted scene that would have come right before this, Pam is going to give Angela some advice. Sam, I'm going to play the clip.



ANGELA MARTIN [00:45:06] He tried to give me a new cat to replace Sprinkles. As if you could replace Sprinkles.



PAM BEESLY [00:45:13] He just has a hard time expressing himself.



ANGELA MARTIN [00:45:16] Well, it's really upsetting me. You probably noticed, but this last week, I've been a raging bitch.



PAM BEESLY [00:45:24] Hmm.



ANGELA MARTIN [00:45:26] What should I do?



PAM BEESLY [00:45:29] Look, there's a lot of good parts to this relationship, right?



ANGELA MARTIN [00:45:32] None of your business.



PAM BEESLY [00:45:33] Right. Well, just try to focus on those. Why don't you guys go out to dinner tonight and talk about ... Whatever you always talk about?



ANGELA MARTIN [00:45:43] Maybe you're right.



PAM BEESLY [00:45:45] Yeah.



ANGELA MARTIN [00:45:46] I said maybe.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:45:50] So, yes. Angela and Pam met at the elevators and Pam gives her this relationship advice.



JENNA FISCHER [00:45:58] I am so sad that did not make it in, that was delightful.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:46:02] It was so fun, it was so fun. So Angela actually takes Pam's advice and is like, OK, there's something worth fighting for here. I'll ask him out to dinner. And, you know, maybe, maybe I'll be able to forgive him. And I'll start with this dinner.



JENNA FISCHER [00:46:17] Well, Dwight offers to make you dinner. He says he will cook you noodles and cauliflower with a side of baked potato. I want you to know, Angela.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:46:28] What?



JENNA FISCHER [00:46:30] For whatever reason, this caused me to Google "noodles and cauliflower".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:46:37] I just saw it as like she loves her starches and she's a vegetarian. What'd you find.



JENNA FISCHER [00:46:43] Noodles and cauliflower is a very popular vegetarian dish.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:46:47] Oh.



JENNA FISCHER [00:46:48] The New York Times cooking page had a recipe that looks so good. I think I'm going to make it.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:46:53] Ooh, send it to me.



JENNA FISCHER [00:46:54] Guys, Google "noodles and cauliflower". It's a bonanza.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:46:59] Oh, my god.



JENNA FISCHER [00:47:00] It's, it's fantastic. I can't wait.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:02] Oh my lord. Who knew? Well, now we have what I think is such a deliciously tacky scene. It is a tacky off, if you will, between Jan and Ryan. Oh, it's so good. He's like, "Well, you know, we should probably talk about the elephant in the room. I got your job". She's like, "Didn't get my job. Not my salary, but you'll get there", and it's super tacky. And then Ryan says, "Scranton suits you". And Jan says, "Best decision I ever made". Ryan says, "You were let go". And then Jen goes, and she looks maniacal, she says, "You know what? Love the beard, keep it forever". And scratches his beard.



JENNA FISCHER [00:47:47] And that makes him super insecure about his beard.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:50] I thought it was amazing. "Love the beard. Keep it forever".



JENNA FISCHER [00:47:55] Well, did you notice what she's wearing in this scene?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:58] It's a Velour jumpsuit, right?



JENNA FISCHER [00:48:00] A Juicy Couture Velour jumpsuit.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:03] Oh yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:48:03] Which were all the rage at this time.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:06] Yeah, they said "Juicy" across the butt. Do you remember that?



JENNA FISCHER [00:48:09] Some of them did. Not all of them.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:12] Oh.



JENNA FISCHER [00:48:12] But the zipper for the hoodie, because it was a hoodie and pants set, the zipper, it had a little "J" as its, what do you call that thing you hold in your thumb and finger to zipper?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:24] The zipper toggle?



JENNA FISCHER [00:48:26] Yeah, is it called a zipper toggle?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:29] I don't know, but that's what I call it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:48:32] Yeah, well, it was a "J". I remember there was this really, really popular thing, which was that brides would change into a white juicy couture jumpsuit after the wedding, some point during the reception, and they would get it embroidered with, like "Just Married" or like Mrs. whatever their new last name is going to be. And I might have done that.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:01] You did?



JENNA FISCHER [00:49:02] When Lee and I got married. I might have ordered one of these white Velour-.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:04] But you didn't wear it. I was at your reception. You never came out in your, your little jogging outfit.



JENNA FISCHER [00:49:10] Well, Angela, there was like an after, after party for the reception for everyone who stayed at the hotel.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:18] Oh.



JENNA FISCHER [00:49:19] You left at a certain point.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:20] I left early, you were annoyed with me a little bit, but-.



JENNA FISCHER [00:49:23] I was? I don't remember being annoyed.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:25] Well you, well you just said, "Ang, you can't leave yet". And I was like, "Jenna", because I, you know, I had a toddler. I was like, it doesn't matter what time I go to bed. She's going to wake up at the same time.



JENNA FISCHER [00:49:37] Were you there for the miniature burgers and fries?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:41] No.



JENNA FISCHER [00:49:42] Because those came out at midnight and I think that might have been why I wanted you to stay. There were also miniature shakes because, you know, I like miniature foods.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:48] I know you do. No.



JENNA FISCHER [00:49:49] I like it when you take a regular burger and you just shrink it on down to baby size.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:54] I know.



JENNA FISCHER [00:49:55] Little fries, little fry containers, a little shake with a tiny straw.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:58] I left around 10:30 and you were like.



JENNA FISCHER [00:50:01] What? You left at 10:30?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:50:04] I had a young kid.



JENNA FISCHER [00:50:06] Nothing had happened yet.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:50:07] I had a young kid. I had to get home, I had a sitter. I had a sitter who I said I'd be home by 11. And you said to me, you're like, "Angela, we're gonna watch the sun come up". And I don't know if you know this about yourself, but every once in a while you're determined to party until sunrise.



JENNA FISCHER [00:50:26] It's, yes. And I've done it a handful of times.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:50:30] Yes.



JENNA FISCHER [00:50:30] And it's always the best time. I don't do it too much. I keep it as like a special treat.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:50:36] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:50:36] My wedding night was one of them and around 2:30 in the morning, I changed into my white Velour, Juicy Couture custom embroidered, "Just Married, Mrs. Kirk" jumpsuit.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:50:49] Well, that's so cute. I want to see a picture of that. I did get a cute little jacket that I wore at the end of my wedding as I left that said "Mrs. Snyder" on the back.



JENNA FISCHER [00:51:00] I remember that.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:51:00] Yeah. OK. So I didn't know that was a thing. And I didn't even know you did it. Oh, my God.



JENNA FISCHER [00:51:06] Well, now you know.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:51:07] Now I know.



JENNA FISCHER [00:51:09] I'll show you pictures.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:51:10] Yeah, I want to see.



JENNA FISCHER [00:51:11] Well, now Jan and Michael are having lunch and Jan is going to explain ageism to Michael, which is just wonderful.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:51:20] It's so good. And there is a deleted scene that they cut to where Michael says to Dwight, "I need you to find out everything you can about something for me. Ready? It's called ageism. Write it down". And he's like, "I don't know what it is. I need to find all the details. I don't know if Jan is just pranking me or if it's a real thing, but I need you to find it all out. I need you to do it in an hour".



JENNA FISCHER [00:51:46] Well, Michael has this great line where he's like, "Wait. Are you saying that old people have the same rights as young people"? And Jan's like, "Yes, Michael".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:51:58] Yeah. Yeah, Michael, yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:52:02] So fan catch from Sadie S. in the scene. "Hi, Jenna and Angela, I'm Sadie, I'm 14 and I love 'The Office' and your podcast".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:52:12] Thank you, Sadie.



JENNA FISCHER [00:52:14] "At 15 minutes, 10 seconds when Michael is having lunch with Jan, it looks like Michael has a personal homemade salad dressing. It is on his desk in a jar with his face on it, a picture of a salad and it says 'Great Scott', just like the production company of 'Threat Level Midnight'". She said, "I couldn't stop laughing when I noticed this. Who thought to make this prop"?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:52:38] Oh Sadie, you and I are on the same page, I have a Post-it note, 15 minutes, 10 seconds. I put "Salad dressing". I think it's a callback from the "Fun Run" episode.



JENNA FISCHER [00:52:46] But wasn't that a deleted scene?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:52:48] Yes. So guys, there's a deleted scene and it's so good. It's in "Fun Run". Michael has this talking head where he's talking about his charity for rabies. And he says, "Look, it's struggling". And he says, "What do I look like, Paul Newman"? And then he goes, "Actually, that's not a bad example, because people have told me I look like Paul Newman. You know, it's the eyes and the face:. And he said, "Also, I make my own salad dressing". He mixes Newman's Ranch with Newman's Italian and sells it at a flea market for a loss. He could make a profit on it if you change one of the ingredients to Wishbone, but he won't do it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:53:24] That is incredible.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:53:26] So I think that is his mixture of Newman's Ranch and Newman's Italian.



JENNA FISCHER [00:53:32] Well, what I like to think is that, you know, once something has been established on the show, we like to track it. They're eating a salad. So of course, they're going to put his salad dressing out. I bet when we filmed this episode, we didn't yet know that that was going to be cut out from "Fun Run". Because they were still in post-production on it.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:53:52] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:53:52] And that's why the salad dressing remains.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:53:54] Yeah, that's right. I totally believe that. And you guys, as they continue talking and eating their salad, I want you to know at 15 minutes, 50 seconds. I think Steve as an actor, makes a very bold choice.



JENNA FISCHER [00:54:06] The broccoli?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:54:07] He eats a piece of broccoli. I mean, you can't talk after that. It's a good thing the scene ended. That would have taken a long time to chew.



JENNA FISCHER [00:54:20] That's true.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:54:20] And I feel like I see a moment not Michael Scott. I see Steve Carell go, "Ah, crap. I just put this piece of broccoli in my mouth".



JENNA FISCHER [00:54:29] I think you're right. I do too. I think you see a moment of regret.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:54:34] Mmhmm.



JENNA FISCHER [00:54:35] Well, now, Angela, someone enters the office with jet black hair.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:54:39] We don't know who because the camera is tracking him behind his head through the office.



JENNA FISCHER [00:54:45] And it is revealed to be Creed. He wants you to know, he's only 30. I mean, well, he'll, in November, he'll be 30.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:54:55] He'll be 30. Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:54:56] Yeah. In November. We got a lot of fan questions about this, Charlia G., Catherine Otto, Kelly Hendrix, Andrea V. and Julie Brown all asked, "Did Creed really dye his hair for this episode"? Well, we texted Creed.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:55:14] We did. We had a delightful text thread with him yesterday.



JENNA FISCHER [00:55:17] It was so funny.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:55:18] I know.



JENNA FISCHER [00:55:20] Well, he said that it was a vegetable dye that washed out completely, no problem. But he suggested that we tell you all that it was a permanent dye that caused all of his hair to fall out so that he could possibly use this as evidence to sue Kim Ferry, who would then counter sue him for libel. And I was like, you're turning our podcasts into a courtroom thriller.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:55:47] I think Creed yesterday was really tickled because he had a whole text thread with us where he went on and on about his different ideas of like a better story of how they dyed his hair.



JENNA FISCHER [00:55:58] Yes.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:55:59] He was having a good time texting us.



JENNA FISCHER [00:56:01] But the truth was it was just a wash out vegetable dye. Sorry, Creed.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:56:06] And of course, we find out in this conference room scene that Creed used all the ink from the printer.



JENNA FISCHER [00:56:13] Yes.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:56:13] He put the printer ink, there is a deleted scene, Jenna, where he has a mirror and he's filling in the spots he missed with a black Sharpie.



JENNA FISCHER [00:56:21] Oh, my gosh.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:56:22] I know. I know.



JENNA FISCHER [00:56:24] Oh, my goodness, well, we might have to start a different text thread with him about that black Sharpie deleted scene.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:56:29] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:56:29] Because I need to know more. By the way, we not only had a text thread with Creed yesterday, just the three of us, we also had a lot of activity on our group "Office" text thread. We were like all texting each other up a storm.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:56:41] Yes. And I had a separate text thread with just the accountants going.



JENNA FISCHER [00:56:46] Oh, my gosh.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:56:49] We were text happy as a cast yesterday.



JENNA FISCHER [00:56:52] I guess we were. Well, like Angela said, everyone is gathered in the conference room. Ryan enters to do his BlackBerry tutorial. But Michael tells Ryan, "I'm sorry, this is still my office. Have a seat".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:57:05] I could not believe that Ryan entertained this. I couldn't believe it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:57:10] Yeah. I mean, as soon as he saw the pictures on the wall.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:57:13] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:57:14] He was like, "Oh, Michael. Here we go".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:57:17] Here we go. It's the lady from "Titanic".



JENNA FISCHER [00:57:20] Mmhmm. The "Where's the beef?" lady.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:57:22] Yeah, and then the picture from "Big" where they're dancing on the keyboard.



JENNA FISCHER [00:57:27] Yes.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:57:28] And then the last one is Ben Kingsley.



JENNA FISCHER [00:57:30] Yeah. And this is when Pam is like, "Why did you reuse the old photos"? And Michael says, "Because the ink ran out of the printer".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:57:38] Yeah. And Creed kind of is like "Hmmm", there's like "Hmm hmm".



JENNA FISCHER [00:57:43] But then all of a sudden someone enters the room, just as Ryan has had enough, in walks Robert Dunder, one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:57:54] How fantastic was that scene with him?



JENNA FISCHER [00:57:57] It was so good.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:57:58] Oh, man. I rewatched it like a few times because he's so perfect. His delivery is spot on.



JENNA FISCHER [00:58:07] Well, Robert Dunder was played by this actor named John Ingle. And this is the only episode that Robert Dunder appears in. But John Ingle starred on "General Hospital". He played patriarch Edward Quartermaine from 1993 to 2012. He did 485 episodes of "General Hospital".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:58:31] Wow.



JENNA FISCHER [00:58:33] He also did a ton of other television work. He was also an acting teacher at Beverly Hills High School from 1964 to 1985. And listen to who he taught while he was a teacher there. He taught Nicolas Cage, Albert Brooks, Swoosie Kurtz, David Schwimmer and Jonathan Silverman, among others. He was also an active volunteer for Habitat for Humanity. He had five daughters and he passed away in 2012.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:59:07] Well, we were so fortunate to have him. He was such a seasoned actor and so, so delightful. And I love this scene.



JENNA FISCHER [00:59:16] He goes on this very, very long, meandering story.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:59:22] But the way he connects at all is so real and organic. And you guys, we have been there. We have all been there at that, you know, family gathering where someone gets up to talk and you're like, "What? What do we? What are you talking about"?



JENNA FISCHER [00:59:38] Yeah, you ask some innocent question like, "Oh, my gosh, where did you get your sweater"? And they're like, "Well, it was three years ago and it was raining that day. I remember".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:59:50] "I remember 'cause I just gotten my hair done and they gave me a plastic net to put over it".



JENNA FISCHER [00:59:55] Yes. "And my friend Cynthia called and she said-".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:59:58] "Well, you know, Cynthia, she had lived abroad. And when she came back, she divorced and married that younger guy".



JENNA FISCHER [01:00:07] "Well, she did, but first, remember, she had that period of time where she went on that sex sabbatical".



ANGELA KINSEY [01:00:15] "She did. That's right about when she got that mole removed. Do you remember her dermatologist? He was such a nice guy. Course he's-.



JENNA FISCHER [01:00:23] "Tall guy, tall guy".



ANGELA KINSEY [01:00:25] "Tall. Tall. And had an accent".



JENNA FISCHER [01:00:28] "Yeah, but I could never figure out where he was from".



ANGELA KINSEY [01:00:32] "Mmhmm. Yeah, he made a very good dip". And you're like, "What"!?



JENNA FISCHER [01:00:36] You're like, "Where's the sweater from? Where's the sweater"?



ANGELA KINSEY [01:00:41] What did we just-? Jenna and I just completely improvised this random conversation. But you guys know, you've been in this moment.



JENNA FISCHER [01:00:48] Yeah, that was Robert Dunder.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:00:51] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [01:00:52] And so Michael throws him out.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:00:53] Wait, can we also? Sorry, this is hopping around.



JENNA FISCHER [01:00:56] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:00:56] Can we also talk about how Michael introduces Robert to everyone?



JENNA FISCHER [01:00:59] Please.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:01:01] He says, "Who is this worthless bag of bones"? That's his introduction.



JENNA FISCHER [01:01:08] To the founder of the company. Well, we also had a fan question query from Erin Kirani, who says, "Robert Dunder mentions Robert Mifflin's wife and her husband, Jerry Trupiano, a South Jersey guy who was tall".



ANGELA KINSEY [01:01:28] Mmhmm.



JENNA FISCHER [01:01:28] "My question is, was this a reference to Jerry Trupiano, the longtime Red Sox broadcaster? I thought it might be because so many of the cast members and writers were Boston area folks".



ANGELA KINSEY [01:01:42] Well, I believe it to be true because Mike Schur, who wrote this episode, is a huge baseball fan.



JENNA FISCHER [01:01:50] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:01:50] And I 100 percent think that's true.



JENNA FISCHER [01:01:52] I think that's a good catch.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:01:54] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [01:01:57] Good catch.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:01:57] Yeah, he snuck in a baseball player in there.



JENNA FISCHER [01:02:01] Well, as everyone is leaving the conference room, Ryan tells Michael, "This day was a wash". Michael needs to embrace the new technology as the way of the future. He really needs to get behind this new way of doing things.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:02:16] And Michael is like, "No, you know what? I'm going to prove you wrong, that the old way is the best way. I'm going to prove you wrong". We don't know what that's going to be. But Michael says that, and Jenna, there is a deleted scene, I have to tell you. There's another department that's very stressed out about this because Ryan has a moment with the accountants where he shows them the new program they're going to use online for all of the accounting of Dunder Mifflin. And it's basically going to make them obsolete.



JENNA FISCHER [01:02:47] Wow. Wow.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:02:49] So, so people are freaking out about this, this new technology that Dunder Mifflin is going to be using.



JENNA FISCHER [01:02:57] Well, we're going to get more of Michael's reaction to all of this in the next episode.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:03:02] Mmhmm.



JENNA FISCHER [01:03:03] We end this episode, though, with Angela and Dwight's dinner date.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:03:09] Yes. Well, lady, I have some location trivia. I know you love a good location story.



JENNA FISCHER [01:03:15] I do. And I will tell you, Ivy Burke will be very excited to hear what you have to say. Because Ivy would like to know where you filmed the Dwight and Angela dinner.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:03:25] We filmed it in the most beautiful neighborhood. It's called the Malibu Lake Mountain Club. It's a private community, so much so that there are no signs off the freeway for it.



JENNA FISCHER [01:03:38] Wow.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:03:39] Yeah, it's like they don't want to be found. It's really, really beautiful. This neighborhood was created in 1924. It was just like a valley. And they made a lake, a manmade lake, and the members really wanted to keep it a secret. So they removed the highway signs that gave directions to the lake, hoping to hide it from tourists. In 1936, they built a clubhouse with a ballroom and a large patio and it had a speakeasy, poker room and a mural of the original members. And only members can use the lake and the swimming pool and the tennis court. So it's this little private community. Ronald Reagan was the honorary mayor and technically that's the first political office he ever held.



JENNA FISCHER [01:04:24] Wow.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:04:25] Mmhmm.



JENNA FISCHER [01:04:26] Now, let me ask you a question. Did you film at this location because this lake is going to feature prominently in the next episode?



ANGELA KINSEY [01:04:37] Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. OK, so we had this location for one day. Dwight and Angela filmed their dinner date in the lodge at Malibu Lake, their restaurant. And then we will see what happens to Michael and Dwight with the lake in the next episode. But that was all the same day. We filmed our scene at night. So Jenna, I had a late call time.



JENNA FISCHER [01:04:59] Oh.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:04:59] There was this huge moon. And after we did this scene, I walked out on this floating dock and just watched the moon for a minute. And it was just like, you know, one of those magical nights on set where you're like, this feels so cool because it's really a beautiful little area. And Steve Carell has made their official website. Ready for this? It says, "Just a few of the famous faces that have shot here, Charlie Chaplin, W.C. Fields, Diane Lane, Lloyd Bridges, Lucille Ball, Steve Carell, Betty Davis, Henry Fonda". It goes on and on. But Steve Carell made the list.



JENNA FISCHER [01:05:36] I love that.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:05:37] I know, right? Really fun. But this scene between Rainn and I, I just loved doing it. We took the scene apart because Dwight is hoping that it's one thing, Angela's trying for it to be a reconciliation and then she just can't do it.



JENNA FISCHER [01:05:55] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:05:56] And they wanted me to be able to show that emotion in my face that I was trying. And then I just couldn't get past it. I couldn't get past it. And it's got a couplet of dialog that I love. It's when Angela says, "I heard a joke today". And Dwight says, "Oh, that's funny". And Angela says, "Yes, it was".



JENNA FISCHER [01:06:19] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:06:22] I just love it.



JENNA FISCHER [01:06:23] Well, this scene is just beautiful, it's beautiful for all the reasons you said. It's funny, but then it breaks your heart because your performance, Angela, we really see your character's heart breaking in this moment. And it's just real. Like you aren't playing it for comedy. It's just real. And these are the moments of "The Office" that I'm so proud of as a television comedy that we took these moments to get really real.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:06:53] Thanks, lady.



JENNA FISCHER [01:06:55] I loved it.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:06:56] Thanks, I really enjoyed this storyline. I, I loved Dwight and Angela being together and I loved when they were at odds. It was equally fun to play.



JENNA FISCHER [01:07:05] Yeah, it's such a good dynamic.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:07:07] Well, you know, Jenna, one of the things that got me so tickled was that during this time, the Dwight Angela relationship was compared by a TV journalist to Hot Lips Houlihan and Frank from "MASH". And that was a show I grew up watching with my dad. And I just was so tickled by that.



JENNA FISCHER [01:07:25] Oh, that's perfect. And that was "Dunder Mifflin Infinity: Part One".



ANGELA KINSEY [01:07:30] Yes. And I would like to say thank you to Joya Balfour for giving us the digital media inside info. And you can check out her website at JoyaBalfour.com for some fun stuff that they were doing at NBC.com.



JENNA FISCHER [01:07:44] Well, when we pick up this storyline, we're going to have some lovely gift baskets and a huge stunt.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:07:51] Especially for our show.



JENNA FISCHER [01:07:53] I was so impressed. I can't wait to talk about it.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:07:57] All right, you guys, have a great week.
