OFFICE LADIES | EPISODE 55 - REVISITED: SEASON 1

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:03] I'm Jenna Fischer.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:04] And I'm Angela Kinsey.



JENNA FISCHER [00:00:06] We were on "The Office" together.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:07] And we're best friends.



JENNA FISCHER [00:00:08] And now we're doing the ultimate "Office" rewatch podcast just for you.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:12] Each week we will break down an episode of "The Office" and give exclusive behind-the-scenes stories that only two people who were there can tell you.



JENNA FISCHER [00:00:19] We're the "Office Ladies".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:24] Hi, everybody.



JENNA FISCHER [00:00:25] Hi, guys.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:26] We wanted to wish you a really Happy, Happy Thanksgiving.



JENNA FISCHER [00:00:30] Yes, Happy Thanksgiving.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:32] We are on vacation. I'm probably eating chocolate pie as I speak.



JENNA FISCHER [00:00:37] Oh, yeah. There's a very, very, very good chance that while you're listening to this, I am eating bread and pie.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:43] But we wanted to share with you guys our Season 1, Second Drink, Revisited Episode where we answer fan questions and we talk about all of those things we missed.



JENNA FISCHER [00:00:53] Yeah. So you might have heard a portion of this when it originally aired as part of our Candy Bag episodes over on Stitcher Premium, but we are bringing it here for the holidays. We're basically covering everything from the pilot to "Hot Girl". So like Season 1.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:10] All the stuff, all your questions. And there are some really good ones. We love it when you guys send these in. So hopefully, you know, while you're eating your leftovers, you can listen to us gab away.



JENNA FISCHER [00:01:21] I re-listened to it. I love it. Even though I recorded it, I forgot stuff. What does that say about me?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:27] Maybe, maybe you need some Gingko, right?



JENNA FISCHER [00:01:30] You know what story for real, lady.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:32] What?



JENNA FISCHER [00:01:33] I got some Ginkgo Biloba to help my memory and I forgot to take it after two days.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:38] Come on.



JENNA FISCHER [00:01:39] I'm not lying. I was like in college.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:42] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:01:42] And I got the Ginkgo Biloba and I brought it home and my dad still gives me grief. By the way, I think it was a Thanksgiving break. I came home with my Ginkgo Biloba and my dad has never let me live it down.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:57] I love that it's become a classic go to for your dad. That's like such a dad thing to do, would be like-.



JENNA FISCHER [00:02:02] Oh, yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:02:02] Really quick, before we get into this lady, what's your favorite Thanksgiving dish?



JENNA FISCHER [00:02:08] I love good old fashioned green bean casserole with the Durkee fried onions on top. And by the way, I use canned green beans. I do not use fresh green beans. I do not use frozen fresh green beans. Canned green beans in my Durkee green bean casserole with a good can of mushroom soup, I look forward to it every year.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:02:30] I do love that. Oh, I love that. I love, like my mom's gravy and I don't know how she does it. I mean it, no store bought gravy, no restaurant gravy will ever top this gravy. I think she takes like all the, what's left in the pan, you know, and then she adds flour to it and whatever. I don't know what else she does to it, but I will drizzle that gravy on anything. It is so good. All right. Jenna, should we get into this?



JENNA FISCHER [00:02:59] Yeah, let's do it. Now, I have a couple of questions. These are for you, Angela. I was looking in our mailbox and I've got a couple of questions for our background expert.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:03:11] Oh, Lord, OK.



JENNA FISCHER [00:03:12] That's you. So Hayley said, "At the end of the pilot episode, there was a cartoon drawing just behind Jim's head on the shelves where they have office supplies and paper, etcetera. Does anyone know what this drawing is? Angela, can you help us out"?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:03:27] OK, Hayley, I saw that too. These things drive me crazy as well. I want to know who would just cut up, like, cartoons and actually not do a very good job cutting. It looks like they rip them out and they tape them to the wall. This is like the second time I've noticed one of these.



JENNA FISCHER [00:03:41] Well, this was in a time, because when I worked in an office, if you saw something funny, like a cartoon that you thought was funny, that's what you did with it. You didn't post it on your Instagram because you didn't have Instagram. You cut it out and you put it like, but you usually put it in the break room.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:03:57] I mean, this is just randomly taped to the wall. But I, I took a photo of it from the TV and zoomed in, do you see it Jenna?



JENNA FISCHER [00:04:04] Oh yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:05] It looks it's been ripped out of a magazine, see how it's like-.



JENNA FISCHER [00:04:08] It's looks very New Yorker to me.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:09] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:04:09] It's like a New Yorker cartoon.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:10] And it looks like a woman in an office, there's a plant behind her. There's like a bar graph on the wall. And it looks like the man in front of her has something all over his back. Do you see that?



JENNA FISCHER [00:04:20] Yeah. Or maybe an animal attached to his back.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:23] We don't know because it goes by so fast. I mean, I did a burst photo on that thing and that's the best I got. So, Hayley, I am sorry, I don't know what that comic means, other than maybe one of our prop guys thought it was funny and he taped it to the wall.



JENNA FISCHER [00:04:38] Well, I have a tidbit about something that's in the background on the wall that we can all enjoy.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:42] What is it?



JENNA FISCHER [00:04:43] It is in Michael's office.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:46] Ah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:04:46] It's on the wall.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:46] Is it in a frame?



JENNA FISCHER [00:04:47] It's in a frame. So there is on Michael's wall a certificate that's framed in the way that you might frame your high school diploma, your college diploma.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:56] Something you're very proud of.



JENNA FISCHER [00:04:59] Yes. Michael has framed a certificate from his watch.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:04] When he bought his watch.



JENNA FISCHER [00:05:05] When he bought his watch.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:06] It came with a certificate.



JENNA FISCHER [00:05:07] And it says, "Certificate of Authenticity. This certifies that Michael Scott", and he had to write in his own name, "Is the proud owner of a quality Seyko timepiece". Now, Seiko is a watch. The problem is Seiko is spelled S-e-y-k-o, meaning Michael has framed a certificate of authenticity for his knockoff Seiko watch.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:37] Yes, yes. And he's proudly displayed it in his office.



JENNA FISCHER [00:05:42] Yes.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:43] His certificate of ownership of a watch. I feel like-.



JENNA FISCHER [00:05:46] Of a fake watch.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:48] Of a fake watch. I feel like Michael might buy a picture frame that has a really nice looking family as a stock photo and just leave it up.



JENNA FISCHER [00:05:55] Oh, I think that's in an episode. I think there's an episode where he keeps the stock photo of whatever came with his frame.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:05] You're right.



JENNA FISCHER [00:06:05] All right. I have another one for you, Angela.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:07] OK.



JENNA FISCHER [00:06:07] All right. This is from Taylor. She says, "Clearly the filing cabinet trash can joke doesn't go over well with Jan". Do you remember that scene where-?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:17] Yes. She's like, "Did you get my fax"?



JENNA FISCHER [00:06:18] And, and I say, he threw it in-.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:20] He had me file it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:06:22] A special filing cabinet that's a trash can. While Michael covers it up by saying, quote, "The joke was originally my brother's". Taylor says, "Michael has a brother? I feel that in regards to his family, we only hear about his mom and stepfather, Jeff, but never any siblings". Angela, what can you tell us?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:40] Well, you know what? That is such a good question, because we really don't know a lot about Michael's family other than the fact that they don't really seem to be very close and they haven't really been there for him. He often talks about throughout the 9 seasons his disdain for Jeff.



JENNA FISCHER [00:06:56] His stepfather.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:58] His stepfather, which I find very funny. But he does mention that he has a brother. He has a line where he says, "I love my big brother". And then he also has this line that this joke was his brother's. So he does reference a brother. And then he also references what appears to be his nephew in the "Nepotism" episode. He mentions his nephew and people are thinking maybe that's from a half sister, maybe from his mom and Jeff. So there's not a lot of information about Michael's family other than the fact that he, he probably was alone a lot because it seems like his mom remarried Jeff.



JENNA FISCHER [00:07:36] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:07:37] And maybe his big brother was away.



JENNA FISCHER [00:07:39] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:07:40] I think Michael was kind of maybe a sad kid growing up. I think when his parents got divorced, whatever age he was at, it really affected him. And Jeff really affected him.



JENNA FISCHER [00:07:50] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:07:50] But they don't, the writers really don't go into it very much.



JENNA FISCHER [00:07:54] But I love that he does have that back story. And this is why he's motivated to make "The Office" his family. It's why he longs for a family so deeply. And it's why you forgive him for all the mistakes he makes in wanting this.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:08:13] Yes.



JENNA FISCHER [00:08:13] And why he comes on so strongly. We give you this back story about him.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:08:17] These little nuggets that he was not happy growing up. And-.



JENNA FISCHER [00:08:22] Yes. It takes him from just being a big, over-the-top TV character to being a real human being.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:08:27] And I think our writers did a great job of giving all the characters those little back stories that made them fully fleshed out people. And it's also why you root for Michael in the end to go have a life with Holly.



JENNA FISCHER [00:08:39] Yes.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:08:39] Because he finally has his person and he's going to have a family.



JENNA FISCHER [00:08:42] Now, let's move on to what we missed from "Diversity Day". Meghan G., among others, said "Hi, in the 'Diversity Day' podcast, Jenna mentioned that the huge shredder behind her desk was never used. But didn't she shred some things with Meredith's son on Bring Your Daughter to Work Day"? Yes, everyone, I missed this and I am so sorry. Yes. The way that Pam finally tries to get some kid to like her is that she shows Meredith's son the giant shredder. I will go on record saying I believe that is the only time we ever use the big shredder. And I think it was a joke when we finally used it, that it's been sitting there for all this time.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:26] I'm sure when we turned it on, like cobwebs came out of it, it was like phe!



JENNA FISCHER [00:09:31] I don't think it worked. I think it had to be repaired.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:34] They had to like rig it somehow.



JENNA FISCHER [00:09:36] Well, something else is the door behind accounting between Meredith's desk and accounting, we never used it. We never go in it. We never go out of it. And that was a big mystery. And finally in Season 9, we see what's behind the door. But, you know, what was really behind the door?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:55] Was the bathroom.



JENNA FISCHER [00:09:56] The bathrooms.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:56] And Video Village.



JENNA FISCHER [00:09:58] Yeah, the green room.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:59] The green room where producers could watch what we were filming and where we went to the bathroom.



JENNA FISCHER [00:10:04] And finally, from the "Diversity Day" episode, Shelby wrote, "Why didn't Jim have a diversity card on his forehead"? Shelby, I don't know. But great thing to point out. Why didn't Jim have a diversity card on his forehead? I looked all through there and I could not figure out if he never had one. I kind of remember him never having one. I texted B.J.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:10:27] And what did B.J. say?



JENNA FISCHER [00:10:28] He didn't get back to me. I went over to Dunderpedia. OK?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:10:34] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:10:34] Dunderpedia is like the Wikipedia just for "The Office", and it lists every person and the card on their forehead. And Jim does not have one. There is no listing for Jim. This is a mystery and it's just going to remain so. Phyllis has "Haitian" in a deleted scene and Devin has "West Nile" in a deleted scene.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:10:55] Yes.



JENNA FISCHER [00:10:56] But Jim does not ever appear with a sticker on his forehead.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:11:02] Is it because John had bangs?



JENNA FISCHER [00:11:05] I don't think so.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:11:07] Look at his hair and tell me how you'd put a note card on his forehead.



JENNA FISCHER [00:11:10] I don't know. I think somehow Jim just managed to get out of it. Doesn't seem like the kind of guy that would get out of something like that.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:11:16] Somehow.



JENNA FISCHER [00:11:17] Somehow.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:11:17] Like he would just like sneaky, because he's cool.



JENNA FISCHER [00:11:19] Clearly. All right, guys. Well, maybe we should take a break.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:11:23] I like it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:11:27] All right. Let's get into "Health Care". Heather wrote in and said, "There is a brief discussion about Rainn maybe having a lollipop in his mouth at 4 minutes, 50 seconds". She says, "It's a toothpick". Angela, can you confirm?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:11:42] Heather, here's the deal. I have now gotten glasses for far away.



JENNA FISCHER [00:11:47] Oh.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:11:47] They're new. I now wear them when I watch the episodes and I rewatched this part of "Health Care" just for you, Heather. And I think you're right. I think it's a toothpick and not a lollipop. Without glasses, looked like lollipop. With glasses, I'm like, hmmm, I bet it's a toothpick.



JENNA FISCHER [00:12:05] You're seeing the detail. Brett, at 5 minutes, 5 seconds says, "There's a photo on the wall behind Meredith. Is that Bob Barker"?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:12:15] Yes!



JENNA FISCHER [00:12:15] It is?!



ANGELA KINSEY [00:12:16] Brett. Yes, it is Bob Barker. OK, and it looks like it's torn out of a magazine. And Bob has like a striped shirt. He's sitting on a sofa. I swear this was in a magazine. And it's just right below. There's a green Scranton Wilkes-Barre wall map index book that's been like thumbtacked, and right below it, is Bob Barker sitting on a sofa.



JENNA FISCHER [00:12:38] Is this something that Meredith, the character Meredith, put on the wall, we think? Does she love Bob Barker?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:12:43] You know what? It fits. He's really tan. He's got a lot of money.



JENNA FISCHER [00:12:48] Yes.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:12:49] He probably knows the best buffet in Vegas.



JENNA FISCHER [00:12:52] All right.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:12:53] This is Meredith, this kind of guy.



JENNA FISCHER [00:12:55] Next question. This is for you, Angela, from John. "Now that we know that Kevin applied for a job in the warehouse, but Michael gave him a job in accounting, does that change the way you look at the dynamic between the three characters in the accounting department"? Angela, I want to say that you always had the most amazing backstory for the character of Kevin. Will you share it? This is, guys now this, we always make fun of my actor prep and my Pam document. But Angela has this backstory for the character of Kevin that she invented, that she shared with me.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:13:29] Here's my theory for how Kevin got his job. I think Kevin's dad, Mr. Malone Senior, I think he was like golf buddies and friends with Robert Dunder and Robert Mifflin. They were the co-founders of Dunder Mifflin.



JENNA FISCHER [00:13:43] It was a nepotism hire.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:13:44] Yeah. I think Mr. Malone was like, you got to hire my kid. Look, we know he's an idiot. Put him somewhere in the corner. If he makes any problems, I'll pay it off. Just hire him, get him out of the house.



JENNA FISCHER [00:13:54] I think this is also why there are three accountants.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:13:58] Yes.



JENNA FISCHER [00:13:58] Because you and Oscar have to redo Kevin's work sometimes all the time.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:03] All the time. And like I have a line that's like when we're talking about being downsized, I'm like, "Well, I think I know which department is going to be downsized". I mean, we have, there's one department that has three people doing the job of two.



JENNA FISCHER [00:14:14] Yes.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:14] That's like a conversation Oscar and I have. You know, we're talking about Kevin.



JENNA FISCHER [00:14:18] With your back story, I think it totally works that his dad came to him and said, "Kevin, I'm going to get you a job at this paper company. Where do you want to work"? And he was like, "Forklift".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:28] Yes.



JENNA FISCHER [00:14:28] I want to work with the things in the warehouse. And I'm sure that Darryl was like, "No".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:34] No, no, no. And he muscled Michael and he was like, "You put them up here, get them out of my warehouse".



JENNA FISCHER [00:14:40] Yes. This is, we've invented this. We just want to let you, John.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:44] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:14:45] This is our own brainchild.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:46] John, this is Jenna and Angela fan fiction.



JENNA FISCHER [00:14:49] Justin wrote in and said, "Jenna, you mentioned your "Sounds of Scranton" mix tape. I couldn't find it on your website and was wondering if you're going to post your "Sounds of Scranton" playlist"? Justin, yes.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:02] She is. Justin, I want you to know, she's embarrassed by it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:15:06] I am.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:07] But I told her it's like that's what's so charming about it. And you have to put it on and we're doing it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:15:11] It's on there now. I just want to say it is a bunch of classic rock songs. And my husband saw the list and he said, "This makes no sense. How did this get you in the character of Pam? I don't understand". And I explained to him, when I was younger and I went on long road trips. This is what I listen to as Jenna.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:33] You listen to "Pour Some Sugar on Me"?



JENNA FISCHER [00:15:36] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:36] I'm hot, sticky, sweet. From my head to my feet. Yeah".



JENNA FISCHER [00:15:40] "Yeah". Classic rock was really big in St. Louis and so it brought me back to a time in my life as Jenna, when I was struggling, when I was driving to my receptionist job and I didn't know what I was doing with my life. And so by listening to that music, it did get me in a headspace. Later when Pam is really upset about everything in Season 3, when she is upset about her life with Jim, I created a different playlist for Pam and it was all very moody, kind of like Norah Jones and Ben Folds, which I think maybe feels a little more on the nose. But the answer is "Sounds of Scranton", it's on the OfficeLadies.com website now, you can find it. And we are also considering if you guys respond well, we might make a "Sounds of Scranton" T-shirt. What do you think?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:16:34] I think we should, my husband said he would wear it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:16:36] All right. Now we're going to move on to "The Alliance" episode.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:16:39] OK.



JENNA FISCHER [00:16:40] Here is a quick list of all the things we missed. Apparently, Angela, we missed a lot. Angry Queen said, "A tad disappointed you didn't mention the sticky on Michael's file cabinet at 9 minutes, 49 seconds. That says, 'Whistle and I'll fart'".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:16:53] Let me tell you something, Angry Queen. I'm sad I missed that too. I went back and rewatched "Health Care" and "The Alliance". I want you to know. And actually the first time you see "Whistle and I'll Fart" is in "Health Care".



JENNA FISCHER [00:17:08] Bump, bump, bump.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:08] Not "The Alliance".



JENNA FISCHER [00:17:10] Oooh.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:11] Look at 4 minutes, 7 seconds in "Health Care" and you're going to see it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:17:15] Well, it's funny you say that because Lauren mentions that at 4 minutes, 7 seconds in "The Alliance", you see a man vanish while walking behind Pam's head.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:24] Yeah, I rewound that like three times because at first I thought it was just like Devon doing a cross or Creed, you know, because they would, our directors would have them do background crosses so that the office looked like it was still busy and functioning while there were people in the conference room doing their talking heads. And so I rewatched it and you're right, it's like they edited and halfway across, Devon is making a cross and then he just disappears.



JENNA FISCHER [00:17:46] Wow.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:46] Yeah. Good catch, Lauren.



JENNA FISCHER [00:17:48] Zanele says, "That at 6 minutes, 20 seconds the show cuts to Pam at her desk and she is wearing a purple striped shirt instead of a pink shirt she was wearing in the rest of the episode".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:59] OK, I actually want to applaud you, Zanele.



JENNA FISCHER [00:18:03] Good one.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:04] Because I went back and rewatched this and it took me a minute because that purple striped shirt, and probably why the editors used it and hoped no one would catch it, is literally just her right shoulder. It is such a quick moment and you got it. So applause.



JENNA FISCHER [00:18:19] Very good. So now we have some questions about this episode. Arland said, "You talked about a scene where Kelly gets moved to the annex because she bugged Meredith from talking too much. But I have absolutely no idea when this was". I wanted to clear this up.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:33] OK.



JENNA FISCHER [00:18:34] This scene never occurs. This was a made up back story that we came up with on the set.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:42] Right.



JENNA FISCHER [00:18:42] As the reason why just Toby and Kelly work in this whole other section of the office. The joke was that Michael made Toby sit back there because he couldn't stand him and Kelly got moved back there because she was sort of annoying everybody else in the office with her chatty chat.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:57] Yeah, this was just a sort of on set, sort of like made up story that that we would, like, joke about why they were moved away.



JENNA FISCHER [00:19:05] Yeah, the reason they were moved away was because they were writers and they couldn't be-.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:10] In every scene. They had to be in the writers room.



JENNA FISCHER [00:19:12] Yeah, they had to be able to disappear.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:13] But we joked that we thought it was because Michael hated Toby and Kelly was too chatty.



JENNA FISCHER [00:19:18] Yes. Iz wrote in and said, "When Michael talks about the 80s party and they cut to the news clipping at 4 minutes, 19 seconds, the article is a bunch of gibberish". All right, Angela. I did an Angela.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:30] I did it too. I went-.



JENNA FISCHER [00:19:32] I zoomed in on it.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:33] I froze that screen. I put on my glasses and I read the whole thing.



JENNA FISCHER [00:19:38] Well, it starts out as a real newsletter, but in the second paragraph is where-.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:43] It starts.



JENNA FISCHER [00:19:43] Yes. Do you have it?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:45] I do. I do. It says, "As anybody can easily tell, this newsletter doesn't really have a lot to say. It's really just a prop to fill in some space and sort of look like a newsletter without really being much of a newsletter at all by typing a lot of words". And then it starts to type gibberish words.



JENNA FISCHER [00:19:59] This is so Phil Shea, this is the props department amusing themselves.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:03] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:20:04] Which they did often. We have a lot of props from the show, you especially, that you saved, Angela.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:09] Yes.



JENNA FISCHER [00:20:10] Where-.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:10] We've talked about it before, I think. Have we?



JENNA FISCHER [00:20:12] I don't know.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:13] I mean, one of my favorite things I saved was a prop, and it is Dwight and Angela's wedding program. And you open it up and it's got all of this stuff in there. And that was, that was Phil Shea having fun.



JENNA FISCHER [00:20:26] I remember-.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:26] I love it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:20:27] Pam's wedding program as well has a bunch of, like, funny misspelled words in it on purpose. And we never addressed it in the episode. But I like to imagine, you know, as happens with weddings, you get your program, you're like, "Oh, what? They misspelled the brother's name"! And it was on purpose. They would do that stuff. Melissa Dawn wrote in and said, "I hope you talk about the fake dead rat in the trap in that scene in the warehouse". A lot of people wrote in about this actually.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:55] OK.



JENNA FISCHER [00:20:55] A lot of interest in the dead rat. Angela, what can you tell us?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:58] Here's what I can tell you. At 13 minutes, 17 seconds, there is this black rat. And it's laying by that cart, you know? Jim is taping up the box and there's this black laying on its side, like using the trap as a pillow and you even see it move.



JENNA FISCHER [00:21:15] That's what someone wrote in and said!



ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:17] Yes. And it's clearly fake. I need to know, what the heck? Was there a prop guy with a string that made its head move?



JENNA FISCHER [00:21:23] I will tell you, I emailed Phil Shea. I texted Phil Shea. I'm trying to get to the bottom of this and I apologize, but I think he is on vacation.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:31] Yes.



JENNA FISCHER [00:21:31] He has not gotten back to me.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:32] He's-.



JENNA FISCHER [00:21:33] It's either that or Phil Shea now hates me.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:35] No, no, no.



JENNA FISCHER [00:21:36] I'm trying not to take it personally.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:37] It's not like Phil Shea would ghost you, Jenna. I think he's on vacation and probably a much deserved vacation. So we might have to revisit that rat question. But here's the other thing I noticed, it's a continuity error, but I also have to wonder if someone told them to get rid of the rat. Because at 13 minutes, 17 seconds, you see the rat and then at 13 minutes, 27 seconds, there is no rat. There is no rat trap. So I kind of wonder if they got in trouble or something.



JENNA FISCHER [00:22:02] Well, maybe it was in the first take and then they got rid of it.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:06] Because it looked to fake.



JENNA FISCHER [00:22:08] Sure. But then that first take of Jim taping the box was the best one, so they used it and then it-.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:15] Right.



JENNA FISCHER [00:22:16] You know, it wasn't in later takes because stuff like that would happen.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:17] Yeah. So there's like rat no rat.



JENNA FISCHER [00:22:19] Warren and Jorge wrote in and said, "In this episode we learned that dairy makes Meredith sick. However, in 'Survivorman', Meredith said she really prefers devil's food cake. Was this a continuity miss or was she just willing to risk it all for this cake"?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:36] I think Meredith would risk it all for her favorite cake.



JENNA FISCHER [00:22:39] I mean, I think she would risk it all on a whim, you know?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:44] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:22:44] Like especially what's that drink? With the milk in it?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:47] The Kahlua thing.



JENNA FISCHER [00:22:48] Kahlua and cream.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:49] She would be like, "Eh, I'll pay for it tomorrow".



JENNA FISCHER [00:22:51] Yes. Yes. So I don't know if it was an intentional continuity error or not, but I feel like more likely it was a choice.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:58] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:22:59] All right. Here's our last question from Mary. "Near the end of the episode, when Roy confronts Jim, it pans over to Dwight, next to the plant, and above Meredith's desk is a photo on the wall. Is that a picture of feet"?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:12] Yes, Mary, it is. And that was an amazing catch. Oh, my gosh. Mary applause. At 20 minutes, 57 seconds, you have to look because it's not just a small picture. It's a really big picture of a pair of feet. One foot is a little bit more featured than the other foot.



JENNA FISCHER [00:23:31] What?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:31] The toenails are painted and it's not the whole foot, you guys, it's just like the toes and like the top of the foot. It's really odd. I don't know what it means, but I thought that was amazing.



JENNA FISCHER [00:23:43] I'd like us to interview Michael Gallenberg, our set designer.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:46] Yes.



JENNA FISCHER [00:23:47] Because they were responsible for a lot of these little choices. But I think he would be a very interesting person to speak with.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:53] I have so many questions for him. I want to know, like all the cartoons.



JENNA FISCHER [00:23:58] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:58] And like, is that Bob Barker, like on a couch from a magazine? I'm positive.



JENNA FISCHER [00:24:02] Well, and they would rotate things. You know? It was, I love that attention to detail that things would be different each week. Lady, should we take a break?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:24:10] I think we should. And we're back.



JENNA FISCHER [00:24:15] So we'll start with "Sexual Harassment". Mandy Lanay.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:24:18] Mandy, underscore, Lanay.



JENNA FISCHER [00:24:21] That's right. Said, "In the talking head that Toby has after his conversation with Dwight, why is everything turned around backward in the vending machine"?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:24:30] Oh, good catch. Good catch, Mandy. Well, you know, probably we didn't have the licensing to feature those items. And you have to sometimes have companies agree to be featured on your show.



JENNA FISCHER [00:24:43] Yeah. Sometimes companies will even pay you to be featured on a show. But more than that, if you do see a logo or something, it has to be cleared because maybe they don't want to be associated with you.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:24:57] Yeah, it's kind of a legal issue. So there were things in that vending machine and maybe we were like, "Oh, wait, you can see all of that. Let's turn it around".



JENNA FISCHER [00:25:05] Yeah, isn't that, but what an odd thing. But I thought that was a really, really good catch.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:25:09] That's a good catch. All right. We have a question from, it looks like Ramone, underscore, 23, underscore 2016. "In the episode they say Meredith has two kids, but as the seasons go on, it drops down to her just having one son. Am I right or am I crazy"?



JENNA FISCHER [00:25:27] I checked the Bible.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:25:30] Ooh, the show Bible.



JENNA FISCHER [00:25:30] I checked the show Bible. And this is crazy. This is a crazy, crazy observation. OK. In the show Bible, it lists both of these things. So on the Meredith page, first it says she is divorced twice and has two kids. And Dwight says this fact in "The Dundees" as well. But then it has another reference from Season 2, Episode 11. The Bible says she has one kid and no husband. Then in Season 5, Episode 18, there is a reference in the show Bible that says she had her second kid for the vacation time.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:26:12] That sounds like Meredith.



JENNA FISCHER [00:26:13] Yes.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:26:14] That is crazy.



JENNA FISCHER [00:26:16] That is crazy. So what is it? It's a mystery. I mean, Meredith's whole life is a mystery, truly.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:26:23] A little bit. And I think maybe the writers sometimes just for the purpose of a joke, might have changed things.



JENNA FISCHER [00:26:30] Yeah, that's right. I think that did happen sometimes. Sometimes a joke was just too good. For example, with Pam's mom, how we recast Pam's mom because they had a storyline that was just too good.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:26:43] Right. So sometimes it's out of your hands. Sometimes it might just be like a writer continuity error.



JENNA FISCHER [00:26:48] Maybe they just didn't check the Bible.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:26:50] Or they did and didn't care because they loved the joke too much.



JENNA FISCHER [00:26:53] It could be any of those things. But yes, good catch. Sent me down to the show Bible. I had to find out. I guess we didn't miss very much in "Sexual Harassment", Angela, I went through all the emails and all the comments.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:27:06] I would not put that out there.



JENNA FISCHER [00:27:07] Oh, well, these were the two. These were the two things.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:27:11] OK, OK, OK.



JENNA FISCHER [00:27:11] All right. Here is a fun fact from PattiShaffneu76. I loved this. She wrote in to say, "SAS Shoes are made in San Antonio, Texas. SAS stands for San Antonio Shoemakers. And you can go visit the factory".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:27:28] Boy, we should. You would love that.



JENNA FISCHER [00:27:31] We should go, Ang.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:27:33] Oh, my gosh. My grandmother, God rest her soul, is somewhere being like go to the SAS factory. She loved her SAS shoes.



JENNA FISCHER [00:27:43] I would love it. I went to that shoe factory in Key West, Florida.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:27:47] What?



JENNA FISCHER [00:27:47] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:27:48] What?



JENNA FISCHER [00:27:48] There are these, there are these leather sandals that are only made in Key West, Florida. And I went on a family vacation when I was a teenager with my mom. And I got a pair of these sandals. They're like 8 dollars. And I loved them so much. And they eventually opened an online store. But the only way you could get them is if you sent them like a certified check from the bank. But it was like for 15 dollars.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:12] Oh, my gosh.



JENNA FISCHER [00:28:12] It was like 8 dollars for the sandals and then shipping. And I did it for years. For years, I would go into a bank and I would get a certified check and I would send it off to this Key West foot-, because they were the most comfortable ones.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:28] Were they the ones, like your navy ones?



JENNA FISCHER [00:28:29] Yes! The blue ones.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:30] Yes.



JENNA FISCHER [00:28:30] Yes.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:31] Jenna, I have such a strong memory of you wearing those shoes every day in the summer.



JENNA FISCHER [00:28:38] Yes.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:39] Every day.



JENNA FISCHER [00:28:40] Angela, I still wear them. You can order them now without a certified check. I'm disappointed I can't remember the name of them. I'm sorry, everyone. This is not an ad for them.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:50] No, no.



JENNA FISCHER [00:28:51] This is just, I really love these sandals. I'm sure you could find them if you Google like "Key West, Florida sandals".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:56] Listen, listen. That's what happens. My grandmother wore SAS shoes her whole life. You find a shoe you love, you stick with it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:29:02] That's right.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:03] I would go to this factory tour with you. That would be fun. All right. Steph Thomas writes in and says, "There was a continuity error during the game. One shot showed Phyllis sitting on the bench with Pam and Angela, and when the camera switched to the game, Phyllis was playing, then she was back on the bench".



JENNA FISCHER [00:29:22] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:22] I caught this too, actually. I caught a few times where she was like sitting next to us and then it would cut back and she wasn't there. So, Steph, great catch, that did happen. I think we shot a little bit out of order and that was a continuity error. So great catch.



JENNA FISCHER [00:29:38] I remember Phyllis with sometimes on the bench with us and sometimes playing. And Kate was always on the bench with us, but she was kind of sitting up on the table, remember?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:46] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:29:47] This is our last catch. Tom, underscore, AVAR. I guess he's Tom, underscore, Aviator.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:55] Well.



JENNA FISCHER [00:29:55] AVAR, Aviator.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:56] That's the abbreviation.



JENNA FISCHER [00:29:58] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:58] It would seem.



JENNA FISCHER [00:29:59] OK. And I do want to say he was not the only person to point this out, but he says at 22 minutes, 25 seconds of our podcast, "You said Michael's book is called 'How I Manage', and it is actually called 'Somehow I Manage' by Michael G. Scott, 'Over one million sold more than the Bible. Not surprised'". Guys. Yes, I apologize.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:30:24] Oh man.



JENNA FISCHER [00:30:24] Much better title, "Somehow I Manage". I think Greg and Steve should get together and write "Somehow I Manage".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:30:34] Wait, as-.



JENNA FISCHER [00:30:35] They need to write a management-.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:30:36] As Michael Scott?



JENNA FISCHER [00:30:37] As Michael Scott. I think Greg and Steve could get together and they could write this business management textbook. I think it would be amazing.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:30:47] That would be hilarious. That would sell like hotcakes.



JENNA FISCHER [00:30:50] Yes. Can we start an online campaign to make this happen? I now no longer care if we have an "Office" reunion. I just want the book. "Somehow I Managed".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:01] Oh my gosh.



JENNA FISCHER [00:31:01] This is my new pursuit.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:03] We're going to get a phone call from Greg, and he's going to be like, "Guys, people are telling me that you want me to write a book. What is this about"?



JENNA FISCHER [00:31:09] I know, I know.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:11] Moving on to "Hot Girl", we got a fan question. Hal wrote in and he says, "I noticed that Pam, Stanley and Amy Adams all made appearances on 'That 70s Show'. I'm curious, what, if any, are the connections there"?



JENNA FISCHER [00:31:25] Angela, I looked this up because I was shocked by this. Here's what I found out, Leslie David Baker, who plays Stanley, myself and Amy Adams have all had guest appearances on "That 70s Show" in different years, in different seasons. Even with different casting directors, I could not find a common link except that "That 70s Show" was on for whatever 9 seasons?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:48] It was a very popular show.



JENNA FISCHER [00:31:51] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:52] It would be like saying, oh, my gosh, these three actors were all on "Friends".



JENNA FISCHER [00:31:54] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:55] You know, it was on for a long time and they had a lot of guest stars.



JENNA FISCHER [00:31:57] And I think that we were just those working actors just pounding the pavement looking for work. And we all ended up on "That 70s Show". You know, Rainn Wilson and I both had recurring roles on "Six Feet Under".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:10] Oh, I didn't know that.



JENNA FISCHER [00:32:10] Rainn, yes.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:11] I knew Rainn's but I didn't know you.



JENNA FISCHER [00:32:12] Well, Rainn's was very famous, he had a very long running recurring role on that show. I did two episodes of that show and that was a dream come true. You know.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:23] I bet, I bet.



JENNA FISCHER [00:32:24] Some of those guest spots, you know, where you get to suddenly, you're just this unknown, struggling actor and all of a sudden you're on a set with a bunch of famous people on a hit show and you're like, "God, I hope I don't screw this up".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:35] I was the murderer on "Monk".



JENNA FISCHER [00:32:38] Oh!



ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:39] Uh huh. Tony Shalhoub is amazing. And I'm such a fan. And Alfred Molina was in the episode and I killed him, buddy.



JENNA FISCHER [00:32:46] Oh, my gosh, Angela. I once did a guest spot on a show where my character had to die. It was a medical drama and my character got such high fever that my brain melted and it was a result of doing drugs.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:00] Oh.



JENNA FISCHER [00:33:00] I was playing a teenager and my mom said it was the only performance of mine that has ever deeply disturbed her. She did not enjoy watching my heart flatline.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:10] Oh, no, no, no.



JENNA FISCHER [00:33:11] No. Very upsetting for her.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:13] I wouldn't want to watch that either.



JENNA FISCHER [00:33:15] No.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:15] No. Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:33:17] OK, so that's it. Guys, I'm sorry. I wish that I had a better answer, but good observation.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:22] Very good observation.



JENNA FISCHER [00:33:23] So WilliamMordon6547 wrote in, "Amy Adams might be my very distant cousin if she's also related to John Quincy Adams". William Mordon, I have some good news for you.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:36] What?



JENNA FISCHER [00:33:37] According to the Internet, Amy is the 13th cousin, eight times removed from our sixth president, John Adams and signer of the Declaration of Independence.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:47] Does Amy know that?



JENNA FISCHER [00:33:49] I don't know if Amy knows.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:50] Amy, I hope you know this. This is kind of amazing.



JENNA FISCHER [00:33:53] Yes. You are a very distant cousin, eight times removed from one of our founding fathers.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:59] Wow.



JENNA FISCHER [00:34:00] As is William Mordon, 6547. All right. So those were some general "Hot Girl" comments. But let's get into the nitty gritty of the episode.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:34:09] OK.



JENNA FISCHER [00:34:09] Here is something a lot of fans had questions about the espresso machine. Angela?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:34:14] Well, let me just tell you, I did a deep dive on this. Here we go. Coffee machine correction. A lot of fans said it was an espresso machine. Correction from Kelly McNeil, "You ladies said you weren't sure what happened to the coffee maker at the end of 'Hot Girl'. Doesn't it make a reappearance in the episode where Michael renovates the Michael Scott Paper Company into Cafe Disco"? Well, let me tell you.



JENNA FISCHER [00:34:37] Angela.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:34:38] Here I go. I went way into the Internet last night, guys, and here's the thing. In "Hot Girl" at 11 minutes, 41 seconds. Michael says, it is a Starbucks digital barista and it cost 1,000 dollars. And you know what? I looked it up and it looks kind of boxy. Look, Jenna.



JENNA FISCHER [00:34:57] Oh yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:34:57] Right? Now in 'Cafe Disco' this is not the same machine.



JENNA FISCHER [00:35:01] Oh.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:02] In 'Cafe Disco' it's actually circular looking and it is called a Espressione Cafe Nova Centro.



JENNA FISCHER [00:35:10] Oh.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:11] It's 400 dollars.



JENNA FISCHER [00:35:12] Is it also from Starbucks?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:15] No. You can get this it looks like on Amazon or Costco.



JENNA FISCHER [00:35:19] Oh I see. Oh yeah. Completely different machine, guys.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:23] Completely different. One looks like a boxy square, the other is like round with levers.



JENNA FISCHER [00:35:27] Yeah, it has sort of cylinder esque.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:29] Yes. I don't even want to tell you guys how long it took me to find this information out. I actually found the 'Cafe Disco' Espresso Cafe Nova Centro on Reddit. Reddit is an interesting place. Oh, my God.



JENNA FISCHER [00:35:45] Oh boy.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:45] So anyway-.



JENNA FISCHER [00:35:46] Sam is shaking his head. He’s saying,  Don't go to Reddit.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:48] Mom, don't go to Reddit. Well I was looking for a coffee maker, dang it, but here's the thing. It is not the same coffee maker.



JENNA FISCHER [00:35:54] Well, I believe Phil Shea when he said we had to return it. It definitely isn't the exact same one because he returned it back to Starbucks, to get his money back.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:03] And the one that-.



JENNA FISCHER [00:36:04] I guess. Even though we used it.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:04] And the one that's in, the one that's in 'Cafe Disco', why did I read the reviews? But it's, it's much cheaper.



JENNA FISCHER [00:36:12] Oh, I see.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:13] Any doesn't always deliver. Apparently.



JENNA FISCHER [00:36:15] Well, that makes sense because Michael Scott Paper Company did not have as much money as Dunder Mifflin.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:20] They would not spend a 1,000 dollars. Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:36:22] They would not. All right. So more about the coffee maker. A lot of people would like us to answer the question, who won the coffee maker? Remember, I bring up that we don't know.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:32] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:36:32] Well, Julia Sniffin found out something very interesting.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:34] Julia, what?



JENNA FISCHER [00:36:36] She said at 16 minutes, 43 seconds, Dwight is asking Katie on a date. And when she says no, he moves. And you can see the leaderboard for the incentive prize. It says D.M. Calendar Blitz. Jim is in first place with 3500 dollars and Dwight is in second with 3,000 dollars. She says, "I like to think that Pam wrote this". So I guess at that point Jim is the leader. So technically, Jim would have won the coffeemaker.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:08] Right. But-.



JENNA FISCHER [00:37:10] If we believe it.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:11] Michael was a little sour, though, about Katie going home with Jim. So that might not have worked out for Jim.



JENNA FISCHER [00:37:18] Yeah, I like to think that at the end of the episode, Michael is just sipping coffee like he kept it. Why do I feel like he kept it?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:25] I feel like he kept it at his condo.



JENNA FISCHER [00:37:27] I do too.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:28] That's what I think.



JENNA FISCHER [00:37:29] Well, Tyler Weirs also says, "I was rewatching 'Hot Girl' after listening to the last recap and I noticed the name 'Andy' written on the conference room sales board at 14 minutes. 36 seconds. Is this a complete coincidence or was this, you know, pointing at Andy Bernard, the character of Andy Bernard, already in the plans"? This must be a coincidence.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:52] It's a coincidence.



JENNA FISCHER [00:37:54] 100 percent.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:54] There's no there's no way they knew that early on that any of those extra characters were going to be storylines. There's no way.



JENNA FISCHER [00:38:00] But I feel like this is what we talked about before, Angela, about these accidents that sort of stay in the ether of "The Office" magic.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:10] Hey, you know, I will go down a deep, deep dive on how I think there's a group mind in comedy and it's my improv background and that when people are all in this group mind these wonderful accidents that aren't accidents happen, you know?



JENNA FISCHER [00:38:25] Yes.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:26] OK, sorry, I geeked out for a second, guys.



JENNA FISCHER [00:38:29] I love it. Laura Sloss wrote, "I loved the 'Hot Girl' episode of the podcast". Thank you. She loved hearing about my poker tournament in Scotland. She lives in a town outside of Edinburgh and was wondering, do I remember the pub that I won the poker tournament in? Yes, I do. Yes, I do. It is called the Wally Doug and it is that 32 Northumberland Street. Laura said she's going to go by and see if my name is still on the leaderboard. Will you let me know?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:58] Oh, that would be great. If it is you have to take a picture.



JENNA FISCHER [00:39:01] Yes, please do.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:03] That is so cool.



JENNA FISCHER [00:39:03] I feel, I feel like as soon as I walked out they just erased it and they were like, "Dang American".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:08] Was it like, was it a dry erase board?



JENNA FISCHER [00:39:11] It was.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:11] Oh, it is gone. Who are we kidding? That's gone.



JENNA FISCHER [00:39:16] I'm trying to remember what year that was. It was before my son was born. I think it was like 2009 or 2010. So we're going on a good nine or ten years ago.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:25] Here's a question from Mally Borowski and Shelby Garrick. They both asked, "Jenna, when you sing at the end of the 'Hot Girl' podcast, did you choose 'On the Wings of Love' because that's what you sang at the funeral for the bird in "Grief Counseling"?



JENNA FISCHER [00:39:41] It is.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:42] Really?



JENNA FISCHER [00:39:43] Yes. I chose it and I wondered if anyone would notice.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:48] You planted a little secret?



JENNA FISCHER [00:39:50] Yeah, well, when you said, "Sing something" and we didn't plan that I was going to sing in that podcast.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:55] No, no.



JENNA FISCHER [00:39:56] But when you said, "Why don't you sing something"? I was like, the first thing that popped into my head was a song that Pam sang. So finally, guys, I can't tell you how overwhelmingly positive the response was to our interview with Phil Shea, our props master. We got so many emails, so many comments about that. And we wanted to give you a little more.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:40:18] Yes. Phil actually was able to talk to us for a little bit longer than was in the actual episode. And he's just a wealth of information about the show.



JENNA FISCHER [00:40:28] He answered more questions about the "Basketball" episode and also the "Health Care" episode. So we're going to play that for you now. In the "Basketball" episode, people had two big questions.



PHIL SHEA [00:40:43] Oh yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:40:44] One of the questions was the face mask that Rainn wears on his face.



PHIL SHEA [00:40:48] Yes.



JENNA FISCHER [00:40:48] I remember that that was Greg's idea and it was scripted, but we never refer to it. Do you remember that? Is that something you had to find? Is that a prop or is that a wardrobe?



PHIL SHEA [00:40:59] It was a prop because it was basically something that would have been in Rainn's personal effects, bought that at a sporting goods store or had a ophthalmologist or facial surgeon. So I guess Greg was then enamored with Allen Iverson, who wore one of those back in 2005. So I found a couple online and we bought all three in, whichever one it fit Rainn's the most, face, the most appropriately, according to Greg's vision, that's the one we used.



JENNA FISCHER [00:41:30] Crazy.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:41:30] Inspired by Allen Iverson.



PHIL SHEA [00:41:33] Yeah. Or somebody in the NBA who had broken their nose and came back in the game with that clear plexi face mask. And it was really the rage back then. So it was very, very topical, very current and relevant. So that we kind of mimicked it, that they had Rainn wore it. It was pretty funny. Yeah. It was just one of the millions of gold nuggets that Greg always dropped into the scripts that made it just a little funnier and a little more mysterious.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:41:57] A little bit of layers there.



PHIL SHEA [00:41:59] Yeah, great layers. Yeah. So and I'm glad the fans inquire about all those little nuggets of great, added to the show.



JENNA FISCHER [00:42:06] Another thing people wanted to know about in that episode is the cold pack that bursts open. Did you have to test cold packs? Like how did you make sure that this cold pack would burst open?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:42:18] And look like that.



JENNA FISCHER [00:42:19] In that confetti like way that Greg wanted?



PHIL SHEA [00:42:21] Yeah, we shook a bunch of them and tried to do it realistically and it never happened. And then we would score them. We would just take these old knives and kind of score, which is basically weakening the fibers of the bag and then applied the same amount of pressure. And then we let Rainn practice with three or four. So he could get an idea of how hard he needed to squeeze, to when it would break the bag. So that was just old school special effects or low tech, we call it, really low tech. We got different bags.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:42:49] Poked a hole in them.



PHIL SHEA [00:42:52] And we pour the material. Yeah, well, not poking a hole but more just.



JENNA FISCHER [00:42:56] Weakening.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:42:56] Yeah.



PHIL SHEA [00:42:57] Scraping. Weakening. Yeah, we did. Exactly.



JENNA FISCHER [00:43:00] So, Phil, a lot of people wanted to know more about the ice cream cake in the "Health Care" episode. Specifically, how many ice cream cakes did you have to buy?



PHIL SHEA [00:43:08] I think we did 30. And that was from the Baskin Robbins store on Victory Boulevard in Burbank. And they delivered them in a refrigerated truck.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:17] Oh, my God.



JENNA FISCHER [00:43:18] Did we eat them all? Or did you have any leftover?



PHIL SHEA [00:43:22] We might have had four or five left leftover, and I think we gave it to craft service.



JENNA FISCHER [00:43:27] That's it?



PHIL SHEA [00:43:27] Yes.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:27] Oh, man.



JENNA FISCHER [00:43:27] I'm sure, who ate them at craft service?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:30] Not the cast. I can tell you that much. We were all about to vomit.



PHIL SHEA [00:43:33] I gave it to craft service and I, I was just glad to be rid of them all. I don't want to know to who eats them or what you do with them, but they're not my responsibility.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:41] I know. I mean, they're perfectly fine cakes. It just like we, they turned on us after eating them for hours and hours.



PHIL SHEA [00:43:49] You guys, were troopers.



JENNA FISCHER [00:43:52] Well, guys, we hope you enjoyed this Second Drink of Season 1.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:58] Yes. And thank you so much for sending in your questions and your comments.



JENNA FISCHER [00:44:02] And I want to say one thing, Ang, we get a lot of people asking us, "What is the best way to submit a question"?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:07] Oh, well, I know that you have a certain way that you say it really helps, so let them hear it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:44:13] OK, my favorite, because I like organization, is when people submit questions through OfficeLadies.com. Because on our website we have these little folders for each episode and you just click on the folder and then when it's time for us to prep that episode, I can go to that folder of questions and it's amazing.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:30] And they're all right there.



JENNA FISCHER [00:44:32] They're all right there.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:32] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:44:33] We also have, by the way, a general Q&A folder, if your question doesn't fit into a specific episode. And, but, lady, you get a lot of questions and comments from OfficeLadiesPod, our Instagram.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:48] Yes, I will go through Instagram comments, Jenna goes through folders. So there are multiple ways you can find us.



JENNA FISCHER [00:44:54] And our associate producer, Aynsely, grabs things from our email, which is OfficeLadies@Earwolf.com. So there's lots of ways. But we also get another question a lot, lady, which is, "How far in advance do you need to send a question"?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:45:07] Pretty far.



JENNA FISCHER [00:45:08] Like four weeks.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:45:09] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:45:09] We're about four weeks ahead on our podcast. So hopefully that helps. So you can get your question answered. We also check those folders and comments after an episode has aired for these Revisiteds.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:45:22] Yes, that's actually one of my favorite things, is to see your comments. And like when Jenna got the synopsis of "Look Who's Talking" wrong, the comments on "OfficeLadiesPod were making me laugh so hard. I like snort laughed.



JENNA FISCHER [00:45:37] Did you love that, Ang? You loved it when I got it wrong and everybody wrote in.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:45:40] Well, no, just because we-.



JENNA FISCHER [00:45:41] You just thought that was so funny. Guys, she snort laughed.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:45:45] I did.



JENNA FISCHER [00:45:45] She just loved it.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:45:47] I did.



JENNA FISCHER [00:45:47] It's her favorite thing.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:45:49] Hey, hey. Settle down because every week I say some very simple phrase wrong. I can't-.



JENNA FISCHER [00:45:57] This is true.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:45:57] It's like-.



JENNA FISCHER [00:45:57] Her latest one, by the way, is your mash up of Betty Crocker and Suzy Homemaker.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:46:03] That was a private mash up. I left, I left Jenna a voicemail and I was just saying how I'm not great in the kitchen, you know? And I was talking to my husband. I was like, look, I'm not Betty Homemaker.



JENNA FISCHER [00:46:15] Yeah, she's not Betty Homemaker, everybody.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:46:17] Who is it? It's Suzy Homemaker. Is it Betty?



JENNA FISCHER [00:46:20] It's either Suzy Homemaker or Betty Crocker.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:46:23] OK.



JENNA FISCHER [00:46:23] Suzy Homemaker kind of cleans the house and organizes it. I think she's sort of overall homemaker. And Betty Crocker is more kitchen based. But I actually think you're getting it right, Angela, you are not a Betty Homemaker. OK?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:46:38] Well, listen.



JENNA FISCHER [00:46:39] Neither one of those things are things you're surper interested in.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:46:42] My skill sets are this. If you want someone to organize your pantry, if you have, like, all of your sort of wrapping paper and it's all in a bin, all meshed up with your ribbon, I'm going to go through, I will fold every piece of tissue paper.



JENNA FISCHER [00:46:53] You will Marie Kondo that.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:46:55] But guys, I can't, like, make a casserole out of just like extra stuff in the fridge. You're not going to want to eat that. I don't have that in me.



JENNA FISCHER [00:47:03] I hear you. You're not a Betty Homemaker.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:05] I'm not a Betty Homemaker. All right, you guys. Well, Happy Holidays. We hope you're having a safe and good one. And we just want to say we love you.



JENNA FISCHER [00:47:14] Yeah, we love you. And we'll be back next week, breaking down an episode, as usual.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:19] Bye.



JENNA FISCHER [00:47:19] Bye.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:22] [Turkey gobble]. That's my turkey.
