[00:00:03] Jenna I'm Jenna Fischer.



[00:00:04] Angela And I'm Angela Kinsey.



[00:00:06] Jenna We were on The Office together.



[00:00:07] Angela And we're best friends.



[00:00:08] Jenna And now we're doing the ultimate Office rewatch podcast just for you.



[00:00:12] Angela Each week we will break down an episode of the office and give exclusive behind the scenes stories that only two people who were there can tell you.



[00:00:19] Jenna We're the Office Ladies. Hello, everybody.



[00:00:20] Angela Hi you guys.



[00:00:21] Jenna I have some big news that I want to share with you, Angela.



[00:00:24] Angela What?



[00:00:25] Jenna Remember when we talked about my long crotch pants?



[00:00:28] Angela How could I forget long crotch?



[00:00:30] Jenna I had them altered.



[00:00:32] Angela Oh, you had your crotch altered?



[00:00:34] Jenna Well, I had the waist altered.



[00:00:36] Angela Oh, OK.



[00:00:36] Jenna I took an inch out of the back of the waist



[00:00:39] Angela And now they fit your crotch right?



[00:00:41] Jenna Yep. I'm wearing them today. I wanted to show you.



[00:00:43] Angela Stand up. Let me see. She got the crotch right. She got the crotch right. Now it fits you right in the butt too.



[00:00:49] Jenna It does.



[00:00:50] Angela Because before you had saggy bottom and long crotch.



[00:00:52] Jenna I know. But now I fixed it and I since I brought the problem to the pod, I thought I'd bring the solution to the pod.



[00:00:59] Angela I'm here for it.



[00:01:00] Jenna Well, we have a very fun episode today. It is Crime Aid. Season five, episode five written by Charlie Grandy and directed by Jen Celotta. Here's your summary. Pam is working at Corporate in New York City to help pay for her life at art school. Holly and Michael take their relationship to the next level, resulting in a burglary at the office. Michael hosts an auction to recoup the valuables lost, and Dwight turns to Phyllis for advice on how to win Angela back.



[00:01:33] Angela I loved everything Dwight and Phyllis. What a great combo. That's the thing the writers did. They like to mix it up. I was here for it.



[00:01:42] Jenna I absolutely loved it as well. That moves me into fast fact number one.



[00:01:47] Angela Do it.



[00:01:48] Jenna New writer alert.



[00:01:49] Angela New writer alert.



[00:01:50] Jenna Charlie Grandy.



[00:01:51] Angela Ding ding ding ding ding.



[00:01:53] Jenna It's another new writer alert. So before working on The Office, Charlie was a stand up comedian and he wrote for The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and Saturday Night Live.



[00:02:04] Angela He's super funny.



[00:02:06] Jenna Super funny. After The Office, he went on to write for The Mindy Project. And Angela, Charlie said that one of the main inspirations for this episode was to highlight Phyllis.



[00:02:17] Angela Oh, Charlie, you did it. And I love that you love Phyllis.



[00:02:21] Jenna Yeah. He said this was one of those situations where they wanted to do a storyline with an unusual pairing. Remember, they used to just put people's names on cards and pair 'em up. This was Dwight Phyllis.



[00:02:31] Angela I love it.



[00:02:32] Jenna This is what happens when you put the Dwight and Phyllis cards together.



[00:02:36] Angela You know what card never came together?



[00:02:38] Jenna What?



[00:02:39] Angela Jim, Angela.



[00:02:41] Jenna You're so right. You're so right. Fast fact number two, this is the first episode that Jen Celotta directed.



[00:02:51] Angela Oh, Jen. That's right.



[00:02:54] Jenna Yeah.



[00:02:55] Angela I mean, guys, it was so much fun to have Jen on set. She was such a laugher. She was such a blast.



[00:03:01] Jenna She was also one of the show runners this season with Paul Lieberstein. She'd been on the show for a while and I don't know if you remember, but during Beach Games, she talked about how Harold Ramis really encouraged her to direct one day. And this was kind of the-.



[00:03:17] Angela That moment.



[00:03:18] Jenna Yeah. This was where it led. So we reached out to Jen and we have some really fun stuff to sprinkle through the episode. I asked her specifically, OK, what was it like directing your first episode? And she said the thing that, like, really stressed her out the most was that she thought directors had to have all the answers. She was really worried that someone would ask her a question about a prop or how to set up a scene and that she wouldn't know. And she said someone gave her the advice to just kind of like fake it till you make it sort of thing. But Jen was like, I can't I can't fake it. If I don't know something, I'm going to shout out I don't know.



[00:03:56] Angela Well, Jen wears every emotion across her face. Right. You know how Jen feels about something?



[00:04:02] Jenna Well, I have to say, I really respect a person who says, I don't know.



[00:04:06] Angela I do, too.



[00:04:07] Jenna I don't need fake it till you make it.



[00:04:09] Angela I would much rather just know truly how someone's feeling. I don't need, like, the whatever.



[00:04:14] Jenna Yeah.



[00:04:15] Angela Thing the filter people put on.



[00:04:18] Jenna I agree. Well, she also said that Jeff Blitz gave her the advice, Don't worry, if you don't sleep the night before your first day of shooting. No director sleeps the night before and your adrenaline will kick in. And she said that was absolutely true. She did not sleep and her adrenaline did kick in. So she was good.



[00:04:37] Angela I bet. I can't sleep like before a big day ever. I'm like up all through the night.



[00:04:42] Jenna I know. That happens to me as an actor the night before my first day on a new project especially. I'm so nervous.



[00:04:50] Angela The day before a big trip. I'm always like, OK did I pack my charger. Got it. Underwear? I don't know. Did it back underwear? I don't know. I don't know. I guess I got to get up and I go, look, if I get like sleep the night before anything big.



[00:05:04] Jenna All right. Are you ready for fastback number three.



[00:05:06] Angela Yes.



[00:05:07] Jenna Roy is back.



[00:05:09] Angela Oh yes he is.



[00:05:11] Jenna He comes back in this episode and it's a huge surprise. It's so well done. The writers said they were always looking for ways to bring David back.



[00:05:20] Angela Well, I hadn't seen this episode in a long time, and when I watched it and he walked in, I was like, oh, Roy's here. And now he's with Jim. Oh, no, no, no. I completely forgot.



[00:05:30] Jenna I have a show Bible summary of Roy Anderson. Remember, we never did a show Bible goodbye for him. So I thought maybe let's remember Roy, since we're going to see him this week.



[00:05:41] Angela Let's do it.



[00:05:42] Jenna Roy Anderson worked in the warehouse at Dunder Mifflin. He was engaged to Pam for three years. They went to high school together. He was on the football team and he hoped they would go to Mexico for their honeymoon. He has wave runners that he bought with his brother, which they eventually sold at a loss. He has a truck. He would carpool to work with Pam. He thinks Angela's kind of hot. He plays fantasy football and he is eventually fired after he tries to attack Jim. He apologizes to Pam and moves on until this episode when he runs into Jim at a bar and it is revealed he's been working at Vitamin World.



[00:06:24] Angela Vitamin Shoppe is what his shirt said.



[00:06:27] Jenna It did? I thought I said vitamin world.



[00:06:30] Angela It said Vitamin Shoppe.



[00:06:33] Jenna Hmm. I'm going to revisit that I guess. I'll take another look at his shirt, although I do believe you.



[00:06:41] Angela Well, now I'm having that moment, like, I'm pretty sure it said Vitamin Shoppe.



[00:06:45] Jenna Oh, dear.



[00:06:46] Angela Oh, Lord Timecode.



[00:06:48] Jenna We need a time code. Well, lady, that's all I got.



[00:06:51] Angela I've got some fun tidbits. There was good deleted scenes for this one.



[00:06:55] Jenna All right. Well, should we take a break and then we'll get to it?



[00:06:57] Angela Let's get to it.



[00:06:58] Jenna I like it. We are back and Pam is working in an office. What's going on, why isn't she in art school? I'm confused.



[00:07:11] Angela It looks a lot like a paper company.



[00:07:14] Jenna Well, that's because it is. It is Dunder Mifflin corporate. She gets a phone call. It's Michael.



[00:07:22] Angela Of course it's Michael, because now he knows where she is.



[00:07:25] Jenna All the time.



[00:07:26] Angela All the time.



[00:07:27] Jenna Well, he knows how to reach her part of the time at least. There was a missing scene in this little runner of Pam working in New York. At one point, Michael's going to call her and ask her for a slice of pizza. She's like Michael-



[00:07:41] Angela and she's like, Michael, if I get you a slice of pizza, will you stop calling? Basically. And then the next scene is Michael opening up like a FedEx package. And there's one slice of pizza- not wrapped in anything- like loose. And he starts eating it and it's sort of come apart in the packaging. And he's so happy because he got his New York slice from Pam.



[00:08:03] Jenna I mean, that is so gross. How long did it take to get there? But I love the idea that Pam sort of passively, aggressively or whatever, I don't know, mailed Michael a slice of pizza and he was delighted. It was deleted, unfortunately.



[00:08:18] Angela Unfortunately. And poor Steve had to eat that pizza quite a bit and he had huge bites of it, like his cheeks were all full of pizza.



[00:08:26] Jenna Well, now we move into the episode and Michael and Holly arrive to work. They are glowing.



[00:08:33] Angela Well, they've been super flirty. They've had two dates. And tonight they're going to go out and it's going to be their third date.



[00:08:41] Jenna Yeah. And Michael says in America, the third date is usually when you have sex. And he hopes Holly agrees with that. If she starts having sex with me, I'll know for sure, is what he says.



[00:08:55] Angela Yeah.



[00:08:56] Jenna So lady, Michael's whole thing where he's talking about the third date is when you have sex. I was intrigued because I remember the show Sex and the City.



[00:09:05] Angela Well, yeah.



[00:09:06] Jenna Do you remember that?



[00:09:07] Angela Of course.



[00:09:08] Jenna OK, so in Sex and the City, there's this scene where Charlotte gives a big speech to the group of friends where she says she never has sex until the third date, no matter what. This is her rule.



[00:09:21] Angela OK.



[00:09:21] Jenna There was actually a book called The Rules that women were supposed to follow in order to like nab a man.



[00:09:27] Angela I remember that book.



[00:09:29] Jenna Remember the rules?



[00:09:30] Angela Ugh God.



[00:09:31] Jenna Right? I know. So crazy. So that was kind of, I think, the inspiration for this idea that you wait till the third date.



[00:09:38] Angela And doesn't Michael love Sex and the City?



[00:09:41] Jenna He does love Sex and the City. So I think that's what he is quoting Charlotte. Except he's twisted it.



[00:09:46] Angela Yeah, he's quoting Charlotte. Yeah. To America.



[00:09:49] Jenna Charlotte is like, I never have sex till the third date. And Michael is like, I get laid on the third date.



[00:09:55] Angela Yeah.



[00:09:56] Jenna That's how he heard that. Well it got me curious. I Googled, is there an ideal amount of time to date before sex.



[00:10:04] Angela OK, this is what's so funny is that I started to look this up and I was like, I just have a feeling Jenna's gonna look this up.



[00:10:11] Jenna I looked it up. Are you ready for what I found?



[00:10:14] Angela Oh, no. Go.



[00:10:15] Jenna It was super interesting. It was similar to our sex timer conversation. There was a Groupon survey of 2000 adults in the United States.



[00:10:25] Angela Wait, Groupon?



[00:10:26] Jenna Groupon.



[00:10:27] Angela Like what you sign up for to get like better tickets to Disneyland, like Groupon?



[00:10:32] Jenna Yeah, I was so confused why Groupon was asking people this question.



[00:10:38] Angela OK.



[00:10:39] Jenna But it's their survey. They wanted to know how long people waited to have sex with a new partner. Now, I'm just saying, if your Groupon app, like sent you this question, would you answer it? I would not answer. I'd be like Groupon, this is none of your business.



[00:10:54] Angela Groupon. Stay in your lane.



[00:10:57] Jenna Yeah, well, here's their result. The average answer was eight dates, with women waiting nine and men waiting five. They also found that men were nine times more likely to be OK with having sex on the first date,



[00:11:15] Angela Ya think?



[00:11:18] Jenna All right. I have a new study. Here's the other study, this one feels a little bit more legit.



[00:11:24] Angela Oh, it's not Groupon.



[00:11:26] Angela It's not Groupon.



[00:11:26] Jenna You don't get free steak if like eight of you sign up.



[00:11:34] Jenna What other survey says Groupon been having?



[00:11:37] Angela Sex Therapists of America log on to Groupon. Oh, my gosh.



[00:11:43] Jenna All right. This one is from the Journal of Sex Research.



[00:11:47] Angela Sounds a little bit more official. No offense, Groupon.



[00:11:50] Jenna Also may be made up, but they analyzed nearly eleven thousand unmarried adults who were in serious or steady relationships. They asked them, at what point in your relationship did you have sex? Fifty one percent waited a few weeks.



[00:12:08] Angela Mm hmm.



[00:12:10] Jenna Thirty eight percent had sex either on the first date or within two weeks. 11 percent had sex before their first date.



[00:12:20] Angela What? How do you do that?



[00:12:21] Jenna I don't know. Like they had sex and then they started dating?



[00:12:25] Angela Went on a date? Oh my gosh.



[00:12:27] Jenna Yeah. So this isn't exactly saying number of dates, but more like period of time.



[00:12:32] Angela OK.



[00:12:33] Jenna They also found that the timing of people's first sexual encounter did not impact their feelings about the relationship in the long run in a meaningful way. So everybody was happy whether they banged before their first date or three weeks later.



[00:12:49] Angela That book The Rules on how to nab your man. That would just throw their theories out the window.



[00:12:54] Jenna Yeah, that's right. Journal of Sex Research. There was one thing. They said that the people who had sex earlier tended to be slightly less satisfied now in their relationship.



[00:13:06] Angela So there was nothing to look forward to.



[00:13:09] Jenna Well, that was one of their theories. One of the theories was that since they'd been having sex longer, you know, that early sex was maybe more exciting and since they'd been at it for a bit longer, since they started earlier, maybe it's lost its shine. I don't know. Everything I read Ange said the best thing you can do is figure out what sex means to you. If sex means physical pleasure, then find someone who agrees. If sex means I'm in a committed relationship, find a partner that agrees. And then you'll have like a really good sexual encounter. That was the advice.



[00:13:47] Angela Well, Jenna, at the end of all of your research, I have found nuggets from Groupon and the sex journal people? What?



[00:13:57] Jenna Journal of Sex Research.



[00:13:58] Angela Thank you. All good nuggets there.



[00:14:01] Jenna Yeah. Well, listen, while Michael was obsessed with the idea that he might get to have sex tonight, Andy is passing out save the date cards. Andy is excited because he's getting married.



[00:14:13] Angela He's very excited. He's calling everyone like D money, J money. At two minutes, forty four seconds, Dwight opens this invitation. He's clearly concerned that there's a save the date. When he opens the envelope, all this confetti comes out.



[00:14:31] Jenna I know.



[00:14:31] Angela And Rainn's reaction as Dwight to it was so funny, but that is my husband's reaction to it. We were invited to a baby shower and we open the envelope. Now, listen, I'm expecting the confetti in some wedding invitations now. It's become a thing, right? You open the envelope and little wedding bells and things come out of it. I was not expecting confetti out of a baby shower. We opened the envelope, and my husband doesn't open anything gently. So we kind of tore into the envelope and all these little bitty baby bottles and baby carriages and little things just like flew up in the air. And my husband was like, why do they do that?



[00:15:09] Jenna I'm with Josh. Welcome to my wedding as I make a mess on your floor. I mean, I'm already I'm annoyed by your wedding or your baby shower.



[00:15:19] Angela It cracked me up.



[00:15:20] Jenna Know what I mean? Don't mess up my house while you invite me to something.



[00:15:23] Angela Don't mess up my area with your festivities.



[00:15:27] Jenna Yeah, I don't know.



[00:15:28] Angela I don't know. I'm on the fence about it. Part of me thought it was fun and the other part was like, oh no, I got to clean that up.



[00:15:33] Jenna Yeah, I always lean toward I have to clean it up.



[00:15:37] Angela Well, we're about to have a little bit of what I call breakin' the wall in the break room.



[00:15:43] Jenna Talk to me about it.



[00:15:44] Angela Are you confused?



[00:15:46] Jenna Slightly.



[00:15:47] Angela Three minutes three seconds. While Dwight is whittling a knife with a knife while Dwight is whittling a knife with a knife, Phyllis wants to know if he's OK. Does he want to talk about it? And she looks right at camera. She goes, you know, I know. You know, they know. Phyllis sassy Phyllis.



[00:16:08] Jenna Yeah.



[00:16:09] Angela Breakin that fourth wall and bringing the camera crew into it.



[00:16:13] Jenna Yeah. And this is the beginning of that delicious Dwight Phyllis runner.



[00:16:19] Angela Yes.



[00:16:19] Jenna That is going to play out so beautifully. At the same time Michael and Holly are planning their date.



[00:16:26] Angela Well, Michael just blurts out- they're talking about where they're going to eat. Maybe they go to the food court and he's like, well, I mean, it depends if we're going to have sex later. And then he was like ahh. And then I mean, this is like how, you know, Holly is his soulmate. I mean, I know we see it over and over again, but she's like, hell yeah.



[00:16:46] Jenna I know. You're so worried.



[00:16:48] Angela Yeah.



[00:16:48] Jenna That Michael has messed it up.



[00:16:50] Angela Yeah.



[00:16:50] Jenna But he didn't because it's his soulmate.



[00:16:52] Angela It's his soulmate. So at three minutes, 17 seconds for our background catch folks, did you see the Taco Bandito menu?



[00:17:01] Jenna No, I. I didn't see it.



[00:17:02] Angela Yeah, it's over Holly's shoulder. I looked it up. That is an actual restaurant in Scranton. It's on 211 North Main Avenue in Scranton. And that was Phil Shea getting us all those menus.



[00:17:14] Jenna Yes. Thanks to his in from Carey Bennett, our wardrobe designer.



[00:17:19] Angela That's right, Taco Bandito.



[00:17:21] Jenna Working together to make it specific.



[00:17:24] Angela Well, Michael is super excited about the fact that Holly is on board third date sex. He has a talking head where he says he'll probably get soup. You know.



[00:17:33] Jenna Something light.



[00:17:34] Angela Yeah, well, Jenna, there were some deleted scenes that really showed how once Holly says hell yeah, Michael cannot think about anything else the rest of the day.



[00:17:44] Jenna I believe it.



[00:17:45] Angela He is so distracted because he knows that he's going to have sex with Holly. There is a scene between Michael Darryl and Angela, like I never had scenes with Darryl and Michael and Darryl and Angela are going over the warehouse budget and Michael is just zoned out thinking about Holly. Sam, can you play it?



[00:18:06] Darryl The pallet truck's got a busted caster. We're still waiting on those safety goggles and we need a new forklift.



[00:18:07] Angela Martin Well, I can take maintenance cash and put it in a supply budget if Michael is OK with it. Michael, do you approve that?



[00:18:24] Michael Hell yeah.



[00:18:25] Angela Martin Fine.



[00:18:26] Darryl Also, we have gnomes living in the wall.



[00:18:30] Angela Martin You mean rats?



[00:18:31] Darryl No, I mean a little scary men with red hats. I think they're drinking all our soda pop. You OK with that Mike?



[00:18:39] Michael Soda pop.



[00:18:39] Darryl Soda pop.



[00:18:39] Angela Martin I don't get it.



[00:18:48] Angela Jenna in the whole meeting, all he can say is hell yeah and soda pop. And he just looks so goofy through the whole meeting. Like Holly has just said hell yeah and that's all Michael can process. Hell, yeah.



[00:19:03] Jenna Angela, I really liked the scene in the break room between Dwight and Phyllis when Dwight is telling Phyllis all of the things that Angela taught him in life, his time with her. Angela introduced him to pasteurized milk. To sheets.



[00:19:21] Angela Yeah.



[00:19:22] Jenna To presents on your birthday and preventative medicine.



[00:19:26] Angela And monotheism.



[00:19:28] Jenna And monotheism. Look at all the things you've done. And then Dwight, he finally breaks down. He gets a little vulnerable. He's like, why is she marrying him? And Phyllis says Angela is not much of a risk taker and Andy's not really a risk.



[00:19:42] Angela She summed it up perfectly.



[00:19:43] Jenna She did.



[00:19:44] Angela Angela took a risk on Dwight and she loved him and he put her cat in the freezer. She's not going to do that again.



[00:19:51] Jenna She's not.



[00:19:52] Angela Well, Jenna there was a deleted scene between Dwight and Phyllis that would just further this sort of conversation, but I'm sure it got cut for time.



[00:20:00] Jenna I saw it in the script and it was so funny.



[00:20:04] Angela It's so funny. And they did actually shoot it and it is in the deleted scenes. So this conversation continues. Dwight and Phyllis are now in the parking lot. They're on the bench by the warehouse and Dwight is eating a huge sandwich and they're talking and Dwight shares with Phyllis what he and Angela did on their very first date. This is so funny to me. Here's what their first date was. They went to the Anthracite Coal Museum tour.



[00:20:30] Jenna Yes.



[00:20:31] Angela Yeah. Even though they had both been several times, they pretended like they'd never been so they could get all the extra information and special perks of the tour from the tour guide, even though the tour guides recognized both of them because they'd been there so many times. And then he said, yeah, and we corrected them when they got their information wrong.



[00:20:52] Jenna Talk about soulmates.



[00:20:53] Angela Soul mates. These two want to go to the Anthracite Coal Museum tour, which they've done before, so that they can tell the tour guide when they get things wrong. Well, I looked it up and Jenna, there is a Pennsylvania Anthracite Heritage Museum. The museum is part of an anthracite museum complex created in 1971 by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. But lady, there's three. There are three museums and one historical site located in their communities. Jenna, maybe put this on our list of places to go.



[00:21:28] Jenna OK.



[00:21:28] Angela The Pennsylvania Anthracite Heritage Museum and Scranton iron furnaces both in Scranton, Ecklie Miners Village near Weatherley and the Museum of Anthracite Mining overlooking the community of Ashlynn. Plus, there are a few museum exhibits also located at the companion Lackawanna Coal Mine Tour.



[00:21:47] Jenna OK, so the Lackawanna Coal Mine Tour is where Michael wanted to take the office as a reward in Health Care in the mine shaft. So this is connected.



[00:21:57] Angela Yes. So hopefully I said all those names correctly, but try saying Lackawanna Coal Mine tour ten times fast.



[00:22:04] Jenna I'm going to do it tonight.



[00:22:06] Angela This is apparently one of Dwight and Angela's favorite places to go. And they went on their first date.



[00:22:11] Jenna That is some very sweet back story into this couple. Now we have a scene where Michael and Holly are trying to kill time before their dinner reservation. So they're playing crazy eights. So cute. But as they get ready to leave and they're walking out, Holly says she forgot her keys. They need to go back in. But then she says she didn't forget her keys.



[00:22:36] Angela Not only that, when they go back in, she turns around and locks the door and gives a look to camera.



[00:22:42] Jenna Mm hmm. She's ready to get it on. She wants to make out in the stairway.



[00:22:47] Angela Yeah.



[00:22:47] Jenna She's worried we can hear them, though.



[00:22:49] Angela Yeah, but Michael says don't worry. Just turn this dial all the way this way and you'll turn everything off. And now they're just so loud. He's done it the wrong way.



[00:22:58] Jenna It's really pretty amazing. The following morning, people are arriving to work. Michael and Holly are glowing. But there's police outside the building. There has been a burglary.



[00:23:10] Angela Yeah.



[00:23:11] Jenna Stuff has been stolen.



[00:23:13] Angela Yeah.



[00:23:14] Jenna We had a fan question from Lachlan A. When Michael and Holly come into the office in the morning, we saw a police car, but we never see any police officers. Was this a continuity error?



[00:23:26] Angela No, there were police officers, but they're in the deleted scenes.



[00:23:30] Jenna That's right. And there's a really funny scene between Dwight and a police officer in the script. It was really simple. Dwight is asking the police officer, do you need any crime scene tape?



[00:23:41] Angela And the police officer is like, you have crime scene tape? And Dwight looks at him like, duh, do you need it?



[00:23:50] Jenna Yeah, exactly. So we did have police officers, but they got cut out.



[00:23:55] Angela They are in the deleted scenes. That little scene is there and it's very funny.



[00:23:59] Jenna Well, there has been quite a robbery. A lot was taken.



[00:24:03] Angela Well, I think we should take a break. And when we come back, let's figure out what was taken, who did it, what's happening?



[00:24:09] Jenna What is happening? We are back, there's been a burglary at the office. Angela, what was stolen? Tell us, what are we missing?



[00:24:19] Angela How do you say burglary?



[00:24:21] Jenna Burglary, burglary?



[00:24:23] Angela Burglary is a weird word.



[00:24:26] Jenna What did I say?



[00:24:26] Angela I don't know.



[00:24:26] Jenna Did I say burgalary or did I say burglary?



[00:24:29] Angela It sounded like you were like burglar, Larry, but I don't know. I don't know.



[00:24:34] Jenna You know what, it is a weird word. Burglary.



[00:24:36] Angela Burglary.



[00:24:37] Jenna Burglary. It sounds like gibberish like, oh, my God, what happened to your house? Ah, I had a (NONSENSE).



[00:24:41] Angela Yeah.



[00:24:44] Jenna It's like a thing you say frantically.



[00:24:47] Angela And if you read it exactly as it spelled, it's burglary. I had a burglary.



[00:24:51] Jenna Well, what was stolen in the burglary?



[00:24:56] Angela OK, according to Dwight, there were security tapes taken, obviously, to cover the thieves tracks. He also thinks that maybe the robbers were vintage HP computer collectors. So I'm guessing a few of the computers are gone. A lot of blank checks. Angela is calling in to the bank to cancel them. Oscar's laptop, Kevin's surge protector, and in deleted scenes we find out Stanley had a delicious bottle of cream sherry that he was saving to drink on his last day at Dunder Mifflin. So now he's going to have to replace that.



[00:25:34] Jenna Now, Angela, correct me if I'm wrong, but Oscar has this line where he says, I have to get my laptop back.



[00:25:43] Angela Oh, no, lady, I have. Wait, hold up. Oh, my God. I'm flipping pages. The line she's talking about is going to happen at eight minutes seven seconds.



[00:25:52] Jenna Now, didn't you guys think he sounded like Jimmy Stewart?



[00:25:56] Angela OK, there is a blooper. Oscar says, I don't want to talk. I want my laptop back. And for whatever reason, when we were filming this, it was after lunch and Oscar had to walk out to like the main bullpen. And he had to say, I don't want to talk. I want my laptop back. He couldn't get the line out. And when he finally got the line out, he went like this. I don't I don't want to talk. I want my laptop back.



[00:26:22] Jenna Yeah.



[00:26:24] Angela And I said in the moment in character, I said, what are you, Jimmy Stewart? And the place lost it. We all lost it because he was like, I I I want my laptop back.



[00:26:36] Jenna But then if I remember correctly, once he'd done it, he couldn't get rid of it.



[00:26:40] Angela He couldn't get rid of it, and then everybody jumped on it. So then Rainn and John and everyone started going, I, I want my laptop back.



[00:26:49] Jenna OK, so I was not there when you filmed this scene, but when I came back, you guys saying, I want my laptop back, that went on for years.



[00:26:59] Angela Years.



[00:26:59] Jenna That was a bit. And I was like, what is it? What happened?



[00:27:04] Angela And Oscar was like, eff you guys. It's but it just like he got tongue-tied after lunch. Listen, that happened on our show. Big bullpen scenes after lunch we would get loopy. You know what lived on forever too is when I said, you send us all these filthy emails. John Krasinski said that to me for years. Were they filthy? I want my laptop back.



[00:27:29] Jenna Your filthy emails.



[00:27:30] Angela Your filthy emails.



[00:27:33] Jenna I want you to know that Kevin is really, really concerned about his surge protector. He's worried about surges. This sent me down a road. I needed to know more about power surges and I am not going to bore you with everything I read. I will give you this one nugget because I didn't know it.



[00:27:50] Angela I'm telling you. I want a screen grab of your search engine.



[00:27:53] Jenna I know.



[00:27:54] Angela I'm going to frame it.



[00:27:55] Jenna I know. I thought power surges were just like giant things that happened like some lightning strikes or something and I need a surge protector because of, like, you know, big moments.



[00:28:07] Angela Can they happen just because you have too much stuff plugged in? Like, I blow dried my hair one time and it blew out the outlet.



[00:28:14] Jenna Yeah, there's something called mini surges, and that happens every time your air conditioner kicks on, like you get a mini surge and it can slowly damage your appliances over time because your house can get like a build up of mini surges. So Kevin is right. You really need to surge protect your house. I also found out you can get a whole house surge suppressor. They connect to your fuse box. I don't even know if I have one. I need to find out because I got so worried about surges after my search.



[00:28:45] Angela I feel like you would know if you had a search suppressor.



[00:28:48] Jenna I mean, we probably do. That's Lee's department. He handles that stuff.



[00:28:52] Angela Right.



[00:28:52] Jenna You know, we divide things up more traditionally in that way. If it's electrical or yard oriented, that's on Lee. I should ask him.



[00:29:01] Angela I'm the yard person at my house. I love the yard. I love being outside. I love to garden. I know our sprinkler system. I set it. I'm like, station 4 is looking wonky. Let's fix that.



[00:29:12] Jenna Yeah, that's on Lee. I've got my allergies, I'm inside.



[00:29:17] Angela You're inside person. Well, listen, Michael and Holly are starting to connect the dots. They're like, oh, no. Oh, no, wait. Did we lock did you lock it? I didn't lock it. Oh, no. This is their fault.



[00:29:30] Jenna So much for sex without consequences.



[00:29:33] Angela Yes, that is Michael's talking head. But Jenna, there was an alt in the script that made me laugh so hard. There was one extra line and this was the other version of this talking head. So much for sex without consequences. Well, I guess with great sex comes great responsibility.



[00:29:52] Jenna Yes.



[00:29:53] Angela And that one was deleted.



[00:29:55] Jenna That is such a good line.



[00:29:56] Angela I know.



[00:29:57] Jenna During all of this mayhem, Jim is listening to a message from Pam. It's a butt dial message. It goes on and on. Clearly, she went out last night. Sounds like she had another volcano.



[00:30:10] Angela Yeah, she's out partying with her art school pals. They're whipping it up. Whipping it? Whooping it, whooping it up.



[00:30:18] Jenna I think they're whooping it up. Yeah. And Jim is just kind of like future mother of my children right there.



[00:30:24] Angela Yep.



[00:30:25] Jenna Which is what Lee said when I got home from my bachelorette party that you hosted, Angela and I was throwing up in the bushes. He said, you're the future mother of my children. I couldn't be prouder of you. Angela says she's never felt safe here. Andy says she's safe with him because he's a very good screamer.



[00:30:44] Angela That made me laugh so hard. Dwight has grabbed Phyllis, they're in the elevator. He had to talk to her right away. He says he knows that Angela loves him. She's practically told him so.



[00:30:59] Jenna Well, Phyllis says, then you need to offer her an ultimatum.



[00:31:02] Angela That's what Bob did to Phyllis.



[00:31:03] Jenna Yeah, he said she had to stop talking to her sister so much.



[00:31:07] Angela Oh, Phyllis.



[00:31:10] Jenna I know. Well, Jen Celotta shared that shooting this elevator scene was crazy because we do not actually have a working elevator. Remember, we've shared before that if we went into the elevator, we would shoot part of the scene and then we would have to relocate to the other building where the bottom of the elevator is.



[00:31:30] Angela Right.



[00:31:31] Jenna And the lobby.



[00:31:32] Angela And there were always guys sort of standing on either side off camera with ropes and they would pull the doors open and they would shut the doors. That is a pulley system door you guys. There was nothing electric about that elevator.



[00:31:44] Jenna It is super fakey fake, old timey, just pulleys and people



[00:31:50] Angela And ropes



[00:31:51] Jenna Making this box of wood turn into an elevator. Well, she said that they didn't want to relocate, so they did this crazy thing, which is so amazing. What they did was, while Phyllis and Dwight are inside the elevator doing the scene, a bunch of crew members came out and redressed the front part hallway of the elevator. So they came in, they put carpeting over the tile and they added a potted plant so that when the doors opened again and Phyllis stepped out, it would look like-.



[00:32:24] Angela A new floor.



[00:32:26] Jenna They were in the correct place. And Jen said, If you look closely when Phyllis gets out of the elevator, the plant is still moving because they had to just, like, slap that plant down really quickly and book it out of there.



[00:32:40] Angela That, to me, feels like theater. That's what it's like when you do a play. It's like,.



[00:32:44] Jenna Yes!



[00:32:44] Angela You have three seconds to re set dress the area while you're putting a blouse on over the other blouse. And then a bunch of guys are sliding a sofa onto the stage. And then you walk out and the lights come up.



[00:32:55] Jenna Yes, totally. And, you know, they had to do multiple takes of this. So that day at work, there were these people who just like threw down carpeting and picked up carpeting and threw down a plant and picked up a plant over and over again.



[00:33:08] Angela And grabbed the ropes and pulled the elevator and shut the elevator.



[00:33:10] Jenna Yes, movie magic. Sometimes it's just practical.



[00:33:15] Angela Yep.



[00:33:16] Jenna Meanwhile, there is a lot of hubbub about the burglary. Holly says her door is open if anyone wants to talk, Creed has his amazing talking head.



[00:33:25] Angela It's so good,



[00:33:27] Jenna He says nobody steals from him and gets away with it. You know, the last person who did that, they disappeared. And his name was Creed Bratton.



[00:33:34] Angela My favorite part, though, is he goes his name Creed Bratton, like, whispers his own name.



[00:33:43] Jenna Clearly he is killed Creed Bratton and taken his identity.



[00:33:46] Angela What's happening? That's what you're led to believe.



[00:33:50] Jenna Well, Michael's going to make everything right. He's going to call a conference room meeting and he has an idea. He's going to have a charity auction.



[00:33:59] Angela Right.



[00:33:59] Jenna It's going to be called Crime Aid. And it's like Farm Aid. But instead of farms fighting AIDS, it's going to be us fighting our own poverty.



[00:34:09] Angela No one likes the idea but Phyllis. Phyllis is like, yeah, we did this in my sorority, we can auction off fun things like tennis lessons.



[00:34:18] Jenna We had a few people write in. They were wondering, why do we have to have a charity auction? Like, wouldn't the insurance cover the cost of the missing items?



[00:34:28] Angela I think this is a good question.



[00:34:29] Jenna Charlie Grandy, our writer, said that there was a scene that got cut for time in which Michael would have explained that their insurance has a five thousand dollar deductible for personal items. They lost less than five thousand dollars worth of stuff. So none of that was covered.



[00:34:47] Angela That's true. It's a scene between Michael and Holly. And Holly explains to Michael that personal items are not covered.



[00:34:53] Jenna And so that is the reason for this big auction.



[00:34:57] Angela As they're sort of discussing this in the conference room, Angela's like who would come to this? Michael's like, I don't know, pedestrian's, looky loos.



[00:35:07] Jenna That was my favorite.



[00:35:08] Angela I know.



[00:35:09] Jenna Looky loos.



[00:35:10] Angela Looky loos, maybe Bruce Springsteen fans. Everyone's like, what?



[00:35:17] Jenna Yeah. Michael says he has scored Springsteen tickets and he's going to auction them off.



[00:35:22] Angela Jenna, I have a Springsteen story.



[00:35:24] Jenna What is it?



[00:35:25] Angela You guys know I interned on Conan O'Brien, right?



[00:35:27] Jenna Yeah.



[00:35:28] Angela In my early 20s. So I was Max Weinberg's intern. Max was the bandleader for The Conan O'Brien Show. But Boss fans know that he was also the drummer for Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. So here I am, Jenna. I'm this young intern. Max comes out of his office and says, hey, Bruce Springsteen is going to be calling me. I'm going to be down in the studio. I'm going to need you to forward his call to me. And I was like, what? And I was like, cold sweat. He was like, Yeah, he should call you while I'm down there. I was like, okay, I sat by that phone. I had to pee. I was like, I can't go pee. I can't go pee.



[00:36:08] Jenna Bruce Springsteen is calling.



[00:36:09] Angela I know. And then I was like, wait, I don't know how to forward. No one showed me that. I sat there sweating it. And then Max comes back up and I was like, Bruce never called. I sat here the whole time. Jenna, I almost peed my pants.



[00:36:21] Jenna He never called?



[00:36:22] Angela He was like, oh, well, he might call later today. Sometime today. I was like sometime today? I thought I couldn't leave my phone right then and there. And then one time someone dropped off a package from Bruce for Max, and there was a little card on the outside and it just said, dash B, like, To Max -B. I was like, Oh my God, I am holding a card that Bruce Springsteen wrote on. That B is him. That's pretty cool.



[00:36:50] Jenna Wait, but you never got to hear his voice on the phone?



[00:36:53] Angela Jenna this is not the best story. I just want you to know I waited for a call from him. I almost got to talk to him. It didn't happen. But I did get to hold a piece of paper he wrote on.



[00:37:03] Jenna Well, I got to see Bruce Springsteen live on Broadway when he did his Broadway show and it was fantastic.



[00:37:10] Angela Did you talk to him?



[00:37:12] Jenna No, and I've also never held a card that says Dash B, so I think you're closer.



[00:37:16] Angela I'm closer to meeting the boss.



[00:37:18] Jenna You are. Dwight is going to take Phyllis' advice. He is going to give Angela an ultimatum. She has until six fourteen p.m. to break up with Andy, apologize, and start dating Dwight.



[00:37:33] Angela Or you don't get any of this. We could not get through it. It's in the bloopers. We both started laughing. It was so ridiculous.



[00:37:43] Jenna This is a fantastic ultimatum though.



[00:37:45] Angela I know.



[00:37:47] Jenna Angela, is it time for the auction?



[00:37:49] Angela It is time for a Crime Reduces Innocence And Makes Everyone Angry I Declare.



[00:38:00] Jenna Yes. Michael says there may not be a wikipedia page for office robbery statistics, yet its victims are standing strong together. So there is still no Wikipedia page for office robbery statistics. And I'll tell you why.



[00:38:10] Angela Because you looked it up



[00:38:12] Jenna after the show aired, fans kept trying to make a Wikipedia page for office robbery statistics, and Wikipedia had to keep taking it down. So now if you type in office robbery statistics, Wikipedia will direct you to the episode Crime Aid. And there was a note that says, office robbery statistics was redirected to this page to prevent further attempted creations.



[00:38:39] Angela Oh, my gosh, you guys are persistent.



[00:38:43] Jenna Also, we had a fan question from Brandon L who wanted to know who wrote the acronym Crime Aid for the show. Guys, this was all Charlie Grandy. He said he spent three hours writing various combinations and he settled on this one.



[00:39:00] Angela Oh, I love that it took him three hours. That just feeds my soul because how many times have you and I sat down to write something and I'm like, well, I spent half an hour on two words.



[00:39:12] Jenna Yes.



[00:39:13] Angela Combinations.



[00:39:14] Jenna Oh, it's time for the auction to start. We've got good stuff.



[00:39:17] Angela We do. I have a list of what all was auctioned off. Ready?



[00:39:21] Jenna Yes.



[00:39:22] Angela We have a yoga lesson from Holly sold to Michael for three hundred dollars because no one else would bid on it. Beers with the warehouse guys from Darryl, sold to Jim for five dollars.



[00:39:35] Jenna But you have to go right now. It's beers right now with the warehouse guys.



[00:39:39] Angela Yes. And there was a scripted Jim talking head that didn't make it in that would explain why he felt like he could leave right away. Jim says, Pam loves Bruce Springsteen. I love Bruce Springsteen and I'm really excited about these tickets. My one reservation is that Bruce Springsteen is not currently touring, so I'm leaving. All right. The next thing auctioned off was a Creed all inclusive. Creed. He's auctioning off himself. No bids. Kevin will do your taxes, federal and state, no bids. Hank sings the blues and he's auctioning off his CD's. No bids that we see anyway. David Wallace coming in strong, auctioning off a weekend at his home on Martha's Vineyard. Multiple bids. We don't know where it landed. Phyllis auctions off a hug. Bob wins that one for a thousand dollars. And in deleted scenes, Kelly auctions off dance lessons and also Meredith mumbles something. No one can tell what she's saying. Oscar says, fine, I bid a dollar. And then she tosses him a brand new iPhone.



[00:40:53] Jenna It's so funny.



[00:40:54] Angela And everyone's like, what? That's all the items auctioned. According to the bar graph thingy, it looks like they raised one thousand eight hundred and three dollars.



[00:41:05] Jenna I have a lot of fan questions and catches based on everything you said, Angela, starting with Audrey E. During the auction there's a giant goal thermometer, but the goal isn't at the top of the thermometer. It's like they're only trying to fill it partway up. That's a really funny detail. Yes, this detail was an intentional joke that was written into the script. In the script it says the amount raised thermometer goes up to one million dollars, even though the goal is three thousand four hundred dollars, which should be written a little over a foot from the bottom. That was the script note. So, yes, very funny little detail.



[00:41:43] Angela And did you notice whenever Michael was being the auctioneer, if bids started going high he would throw in a million dollars, he'd be like one hundred million dollars. OK, four hundred.



[00:41:55] Jenna We had a fan catch from many people, Erica P., Rob O., Katie D., and Ashley S., when Jim leaves to go to the bar with Darryl, Michael auctions off Creed. But if you look, Jim is seated behind Creed.



[00:42:12] Angela Oh, good catch.



[00:42:14] Jenna Jim should not be there. But clearly we moved those scenes around. Also fan question from Catherine D, Lexie B, and Matty L. Is Hank really a blues musician? No. So not only is Hugh Dane, who plays Hank, not a blues musician, he had never played the guitar before that day. And this bit about Hank being a blues musician was a holdover from an earlier draft of the script. Jen Celotta told me it didn't even make it in the shooting draft, but there was a whole storyline where Oscar and Kevin were going to try to solve the crime of who broke into the office and they decide that it must be an inside job because the door wasn't broken. So they're interviewing everyone. They interview Hank and they say, Hank, do you have a record? And Hank says, I do have a record, but it's a blues record, not a criminal record. So Jen always loved that joke that Hank said, I have a record, I have a blues record. So she said, I want Hank to auction off his blues record at this auction. But it was a super last minute pitch. Jen told me they only had a couple hours to make the prop CD, which is why, if you notice, Hank is wearing the same outfit in the CD that he's wearing in the episode.



[00:43:40] Angela Well, and it also said in the script that Hank plays very poorly and we're all having to sit there and listen.



[00:43:47] Jenna Angela, because of this auction, I became inspired to find out what are some of the world's best selling auction items?



[00:43:57] Angela Like what you see in the news, like Christie's auctioned off a Picasso or something like that?



[00:44:02] Jenna Yes, yes. I have a list.



[00:44:05] Angela Of the highest paid items ever at an auction?



[00:44:09] Jenna Yes. In certain categories. For example, the world's most expensive work of art sold at auction was a 500 year old painting of Jesus Christ, believed to have been painted by Leonardo da Vinci.



[00:44:24] Angela Oh, I was going to say Da Vinci's on this list. I really was. OK, go.



[00:44:28] Jenna The painting is known as Salvator Mundi, which means savior of the world. And it sold at Christie's auction in twenty seventeen for four hundred and fifty million dollars.



[00:44:39] Angela Dang. Who bought it?



[00:44:42] Jenna I don't know.



[00:44:43] Angela Oh my god.



[00:44:43] Jenna I wouldn't want you to know that I have that. I mean that feels like a security risk.



[00:44:47] Angela Right. It's got to be anonymous.



[00:44:50] Jenna I don't know if it is or not, but it didn't say. The record for the most expensive work of art by a living artist goes to Jeff Koons, his rabbit sculpture, which sold for ninety one point one million in May of two thousand nineteen.



[00:45:08] Angela Wow.



[00:45:09] Jenna Jeff Koons actually has two of the top five items that were most expensive for a living artist. Also, his dog sculpture, his like balloon dog.



[00:45:21] Angela Wow.



[00:45:22] Jenna The most expensive dress ever sold at an auction.



[00:45:26] Angela Ooh can, I guess?



[00:45:27] Jenna Yes.



[00:45:31] Angela Was it either Audrey Hepburn or like Princess Diana?



[00:45:35] Jenna It's Marilyn Monroe.



[00:45:37] Angela Ah, Marilyn Monroe. Why didn't I say Marilyn Monroe?



[00:45:39] Jenna Her Happy Birthday, Mr. President gown.



[00:45:42] Angela Oh, yes.



[00:45:44] Jenna It sold for four point eight million dollars in 2016. The most expensive wristwatch ever auctioned. I mean, I found this fascinating because I was like, really a watch? Sold for thirty one million dollars.



[00:46:00] Angela I don't get it.



[00:46:01] Jenna It's called a Patek Philippe watch. It was in the Grand Master Chime model. Now, does that make more sense, Angela? It was a grand master chime.



[00:46:12] Angela Somewhere there's someone fancy and their ears are bleeding because they're like ladies, you have no idea what you're talking about.



[00:46:18] Jenna Yeah, we need to pay thirty one million for the grand master chime.



[00:46:22] Angela I hid this watch up my ass.



[00:46:24] Jenna Oh boy. That watch. I'd love to know how much that watch could go for at auction, but this shattered the record. The previous record was a Rolex that was once owned by Paul Newman and it had sold for seventeen point seven. I don't want to tell people that they're spending their money wrong, but I don't know. Do you want to know the most expensive diamonds?



[00:46:46] Angela I mean, does Elizabeth have one?



[00:46:48] Jenna No, I'm sorry. Elizabeth Taylor did not sell the most expensive diamond. The most expensive blue diamond ever sold in auction history was the Oppenheimer Blue, and it sold for fifty seven point nine million dollars. The most expensive diamond diamond was sold for seventy one point two dollars million at an auction in Hong Kong, and it is a fifty nine point six carat pink star diamond.



[00:47:18] Angela Wow.



[00:47:19] Jenna And it was the largest flawless, fancy, vivid pink diamond ever graded by the Gemological Institute of America.



[00:47:28] Angela What do you do with that?



[00:47:30] Jenna I don't know. It is such.



[00:47:31] Angela What do you do with that? It would stress me out.



[00:47:34] Jenna I don't know what you do with it.



[00:47:36] Angela I mean, I'm always like, you know, you have one lamp that's nicer than your other lamps. And I'm always like to the kids, don't touch that lamp, guys.



[00:47:45] Jenna You guys stop touching the pink star diamond. Stop it. If you have to play with something, play with the Oppenheimer Blue.



[00:47:53] Angela Do not throw the Frisbee near that diamond, dammit. Stop it, guys.



[00:47:58] Angela That's how my other diamond broke.



[00:48:00] Jenna Exactly. And no, you cannot wear my grandmaster chime to school. Finally, I'm going to tell you what I am assuming is the most expensive used tissue.



[00:48:12] Angela What?



[00:48:13] Jenna That has ever been auctioned, I can't be sure.



[00:48:16] Angela Who wants a used tissue?



[00:48:18] Jenna Somebody did.



[00:48:19] Angela Did Elvis blow his nose- is this an Elvis tissue?



[00:48:22] Jenna No, it belonged to Scarlett Johansson. She sold it for two thousand and fifty dollars on eBay. The story is that she had been on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in 2008 and she had a cold. She said Samuel L. Jackson gave me a cold and she said, you know what? I'm going to auction off my tissue for charity. And she did.



[00:48:44] Angela OK. All right. You know what I learned here? People bid crazy amounts of money on really random things.



[00:48:51] Jenna Yeah. Should we go to the bar? Should we get back to the episode and go to the bar?



[00:48:56] Angela I guess so. Well, Jim and the warehouse fellows are having a great time at the bar. Jim's going to get another round. He heads over to the bar. And who walks in?



[00:49:06] Jenna It's Roy.



[00:49:07] Angela Roy Anderson. He's like, Halpert, and Jim's like uhhhh and Roy's like, don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.



[00:49:14] Jenna So Jim and Roy end up having a rather friendly conversation over some beers. They're catching up on life. He's telling Roy about Pam.



[00:49:22] Angela Yeah. He tells Roy Pam's at art school. And also she's engaged to me. Roy's like, wow, OK. And then they kind of do like a they don't quite shake hands. It's weird. It's like Roy holds his hand up over his shoulder and then Jim grabs it. They have some type of bro handshake moment.



[00:49:41] Jenna I loved that. Jim even sort of doubles down and is like, oh, yeah, she's having a great time at art school. She was out to like 9:00 in the morning with her friends. And then Roy says, Huh, you were a friend.



[00:49:54] Angela And Jim is like, oh, crap, oh, crap, like, it kind of plants the seed of doubt in Jim's brain, like is Pam connecting with other people the way she connected with me. What's going on at art school?



[00:50:08] Jenna So Jim spirals and he's like, I'm going to I'm going to go see her. I'm going to go see her. I'm going to drive to New York. I want you guys to know that there were some missing scenes in this Jim and Pam storyline. There were extra scenes because we did get some mail from people where they were like, wow, this one comment from Roy really made Jim Spiral. You know, why was he so insecure about their relationship? Now we know he's going to turn around. He's not actually going to drive to New York. He's going to turn around. But there's a lot more motivating this spiral than just Roy's comment.



[00:50:44] Angela Yes, there was a whole storyline, you guys, between Jim and Pam that would have started early in the episode and would have built to this moment.



[00:50:52] Jenna Yeah. So earlier, remember, Jim was on the phone and he got this voicemail from Pam where she's out with her friends. Well, what's missing is that there was a really cute bit where Jim and Pam are talking on the phone and they are talking about the West Wing.



[00:51:09] Angela Yes. And Jenna, it's so cute. They share that they watch it together on the DVD. So, like, they both have to hit play at the same time. I thought that was so cute. I have done that with friends.



[00:51:19] Jenna So cute.



[00:51:20] Angela This is old tech romance guys.



[00:51:22] Jenna In the script, this scene goes on and Jim says, Are we on for the next episode tonight? Pam says, you know what? Can we raincheck it? Basically, you know, she says, I'm really tired. I think I'm just going to go to bed early.



[00:51:35] Angela Yeah, she's had a big week at school.



[00:51:37] Jenna Yeah. So, you know, fine. But then later, what happens is she leaves Jim a message where she says, oh my gosh, my friends, they're dragging me out. They convinced me to go out. I'll call you later. Then Jim gets the butt dial.



[00:51:53] Angela From the bar.



[00:51:55] Jenna From the bar where she's having a great time. And then Pam leaves him a message explaining that she did not get home until 8:00 in the morning. So she was too tired to watch West Wing, but she went out with friends till eight in the morning. So that is really why Jim spirals for a second and is going to drive to New York.



[00:52:16] Angela Yeah, that's why Roy's comment really took root, you know, because he's like, well, wait a second. I kind of feel like she just blew me off for these people I don't even know.



[00:52:27] Jenna Yeah, and we're just going to leave you hanging on that one by the way. Jim drives back and you know, we'll work this out in the next episode. Well, back at the auction, it's six fourteen.



[00:52:40] Angela Yeah.



[00:52:41] Jenna It's the deadline.



[00:52:43] Angela Dwight looks over at Angela and Angela purposefully looks to Andy. Dwight is crushed.



[00:52:50] Jenna She's made her choice.



[00:52:52] Angela She's made her choice. Well, there was a scripted Angela talking head that didn't make it in that would have gone right here. And Angela says, I'm not the type of person who breaks engagements. You should go talk to Pam. Once again Angela is gonna throw Pam under the bus. When it comes to questions about her personal life, she's like, wait, who can I distract with? Oh, yeah, Pam.



[00:53:16] Jenna Dwight is like, Phyllis! Phyllis. Someone has let the air out of all of your tires come look. And Phyllis goes outside and yes, her tires are all flat. And Dwight's like no, no, no. I just needed an excuse to get you out here. And I love Phyllis' line, like why couldn't you have just said it. Why do you have to do it? But Dwight's like what do I do now? What do I do now. The ultimatum passed. And that's when Phyllis is like, well I think you have your answer. It's the end, Dwight. That's what happens.



[00:53:49] Angela You got to let it go.



[00:53:51] Jenna Yeah.



[00:53:52] Angela Dwight is furious with Phyllis, but then he has this moment when he's by himself and he's like, you know, kind of like, how dare her? She's so selfish. Here she was just trying to help me. And then he sort of hears what he's just said. She was just trying to help him.



[00:54:07] Jenna That's what motivates him to go in and bid on her hug and drive the price up. Ultimately, it goes to Bob Vance.



[00:54:15] Angela And Angela is so confused. She's like, why is Dwight bidding on a hug with Phyllis like so aggressively? It's his way of saying thank you, I guess.



[00:54:23] Jenna Yeah, well, she's the big winner of the night. It goes for the most money because as it turns out, Michael can't find the Springsteen tickets. Can you believe it?



[00:54:32] Angela Oh, what could have happened to them?



[00:54:34] Jenna Where are they?



[00:54:35] Angela He definitely had them all the time.



[00:54:37] Jenna He definitely had them.



[00:54:39] Angela Even though we learned that, you know, they're not even touring right now.



[00:54:44] Jenna Well, there's a very sweet scene now between Michael and Holly where Michael does admit that it's kind of a gray area, whether or not he had the Springsteen tickets.



[00:54:54] Angela A lot about Michael is too good to be true, she says.



[00:54:57] Jenna Well, Ange, you know how Jen Celotta was always ruining takes by laughing on set?



[00:55:02] Angela Yes.



[00:55:03] Jenna All the time, especially talking heads. Well Jen told me that she totally ruined a take during this scene. She says the moment when Holly is trying to cover Michael's mouth and tell him, don't say it, don't say it, and then how Michael is sort of delighted by this so he starts laughing and then Holly starts laughing. Jen said that it felt so real to her that she thought they had broke. So Jen started laughing and ultimately ruined the take. And Steve was like, why were you laughing? And she said, I thought you were breaking. And he said, no, we were just acting. And then they all kind of laughed at that. But she said that moment made it onto the blooper reel.



[00:55:42] Angela It did. I watched it. It's on season five bloopers on YouTube. You can see Jen cracking up.



[00:55:49] Jenna The episode ends with a kiss. Michael and Holly kiss.



[00:55:54] Angela More than once. There's a little kiss, then a bigger kiss. You guys they're at work.



[00:55:59] Jenna Yeah. And David Wallace is there. He's watching from a distance.



[00:56:04] Angela Mm hmm.



[00:56:05] Jenna And this episode ends with him saying, no, I did not know that Michael was dating Holly.



[00:56:09] Angela He doesn't seem happy about it.



[00:56:12] Jenna Yeah, he's not. I mean, look what happened when Michael dated Jan.



[00:56:17] Angela Oh, my gosh.



[00:56:18] Jenna But, David, what you don't know is that these guys are soul mates. ugh. But this is going to cause some problems for this couple going forward. We have a lot of couples in crisis.



[00:56:33] Angela Yeah. Season five.



[00:56:35] Jenna Dwangela, Jam, Molly or Hichael. What are we calling them? Hichael?



[00:56:40] Angela Holly and Michael.



[00:56:43] Jenna Yeah, they're either Molly or Hichael. Hichael.



[00:56:48] Angela Hichael. Season five, shaking it up, guys, shaking it up.



[00:56:52] Jenna Well, there you have it, that's Crime Aid.



[00:56:54] Angela I certainly learned a lot this episode. For example, Groupon doing crazy surveys.



[00:57:01] Jenna Yeah, very crazy surveys. And we know the most expensive used tissue ever sold at auction that I could find.



[00:57:09] Angela Mm hmm. There could be more.



[00:57:10] Jenna There could be more. But as far as I could find, that record goes to Scarlett Johansson.



[00:57:16] Angela Congratulations, Scarlett.



[00:57:18] Jenna And in Crime Aid, the most expensive item sold goes to Phyllis.



[00:57:23] Angela Way to go Phyllis.



[00:57:24] Jenna Way to go Phyllis. I'd take that hug.



[00:57:26] Angela It's a good hug. All right, guys.



[00:57:28] Jenna We'll see you next week.



[00:57:30] Angela We'll see you next week. We hope you have a good one.
