OFFICE LADIES | EPISODE 57 - FUN RUN PART 2

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:04] I'm Jenna Fischer.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:05] And I'm Angela Kinsey.



JENNA FISCHER [00:00:06] We were on "The Office" together.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:07] And we're best friends.



JENNA FISCHER [00:00:08] And now we're doing the ultimate "Office" rewatch podcast just for you.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:12] Each week we will break down an episode of "The Office" and give exclusive behind-the-scenes stories that only two people who were there can tell you.



JENNA FISCHER [00:00:19] We're "The Office" Ladies. On your mark, get set, go. Angela, it's a Fun Run.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:28] Wait, I got to carb load a bunch of fettuccini three seconds before I run.



JENNA FISCHER [00:00:33] Good idea. That's not going to turn on you.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:37] Give me the creamy carbs seconds before I take off on a huge adventure.



JENNA FISCHER [00:00:43] Guys, it is "Fun Run: Part 2". This is the very beginning of Season 4, written by Greg Daniels, directed by Greg Daniels. Let me hit ya up with a summary. "Last week, Michael hit Meredith with his car, breaking her pelvis. And we discovered, though, that Meredith's trip to the hospital may have saved her life since it was revealed she had possibly been exposed to rabies and has now received a vaccine. We also found out that Sprinkles died on Dwight's watch".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:16] On Dwight's watch?



JENNA FISCHER [00:01:20] Well, this week, this week, Michael organizes a Fun Run to raise money for rabies in honor of Meredith. And we find out what really happened to Sprinkles.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:33] Do you see what I'm wearing in honor of this episode?



JENNA FISCHER [00:01:37] You're wearing your "Office Ladies" Sprinkles sweatshirt.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:40] I am wearing my Sprinkles sweatshirt.



JENNA FISCHER [00:01:42] Well, lady, I did not wear anything in honor of Sprinkles today. I'm sorry.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:45] Well, you know what? That tracks for Pam in this episode because she helps, like Angela, let's see, zero amount. Zero amount.



JENNA FISCHER [00:01:55] Sorry.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:57] It's OK.



JENNA FISCHER [00:01:58] She's distracted because in this episode, it's also going to be revealed that Jim and Pam are dating.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:02:03] Listen, one thing when I thought of when I watched this episode was, wow, happy Pam is a sassy Pam. She gives zero Fs about what's going on around her. She's a totally different person.



JENNA FISCHER [00:02:16] Happy Sass.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:02:17] Happy Sass.



JENNA FISCHER [00:02:18] Is that a thing?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:02:19] Happy Pam Sass.



JENNA FISCHER [00:02:20] Happy Pam Sass. Well, let's get into these Fast Facts. Fast Fact Number One, you know, this episode is technically the second part of the episode that we broke down last week. Right?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:02:32] Mmhmm, mmhmm.



JENNA FISCHER [00:02:33] Because these episodes were an hour long. But if you notice, I feel like these episodes really stand on their own. They kind of both had their own little plots. Right?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:02:43] For sure.



JENNA FISCHER [00:02:45] Well, I talked to Greg about that and he told me that Kevin Reilly requested four hour long episodes to kick off Season 4. So the first four episodes of this season are all an hour long.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:02:58] Kevin loved our show, but was there any other reason besides, he was like, "I want more 'Office'".



JENNA FISCHER [00:03:04] I think it was just that would be a big announcement in the press, the return of "The Office" four hour long episodes. Maybe also they didn't have something for the other time slot. So we were filling two time slots. I'm speculating. I don't know.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:03:23] I like you're speculating face and tone, because my husband does this sometimes when he wants to let the kids down easy, like, it's like, "Hey, guys, so about those pumpkins that we were gonna get. They, they exploited from the heat. But...".



JENNA FISCHER [00:03:42] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:03:43] Well, I was excited that we got these big supersized episodes. It meant that for the supporting cast, some of our storylines would definitely stay in and that was exciting.



JENNA FISCHER [00:03:53] Yes. Well, Greg also told me that Kevin Reilly told him they're only going to run in this hour long length once, at the beginning of the season. Then we're going to have to rerun them later as half hours, and that's really why they stand alone. Greg said it was a challenge because he had to wrap up the first episode in a way that would make it satisfying for a future viewer to watch it in a half hour form, but he couldn't wrap it up too much for the people who were watching it as a one hour episode. He said it was kind of a writing challenge.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:28] That sounds like a challenge.



JENNA FISCHER [00:04:30] I think he did it, though.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:31] I think he crushed it. Greg Daniels-.



JENNA FISCHER [00:04:34] He crushed it.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:34] You crushed it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:04:36] Fast Fact Number Two, lady, is a wardrobe breakdown with Carey Bennett.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:42] I love me some Carey Bennett. Let's hear it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:04:45] We got so much mail about the wardrobe in this episode, which makes sense because we're seeing everybody out of their office attire.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:53] Mmhmm.



JENNA FISCHER [00:04:55] Which Carey said was always a challenge because she had created these office uniforms for people. So any time we wore our quote unquote, "street clothes", she was like, "Who are these people in their street clothes"? Here are some of the mail we got. Alicia W. and Amanda Mitchenfelder said, "Did you get to keep your shirts from 'Fun Run'"? And Emily Thomas wants to know, "Did you get to keep a 'Support the Rabid' wristband"? Yeah, I kept both. I kept my shirt and I kept my wristband.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:27] I had my wristband for a long time. It's probably somewhere in my scrapbook bin. My T-shirt I did not keep, Carey kept it in case we ever needed Angela Martin to wear it again because we weren't sure how long this mourning process was going to go, you know?



JENNA FISCHER [00:05:46] Well, we should remind people, Angela, you did not wear one of the famous blue "Fun Run" T-shirts, you wore a shirt with a picture of Sprinkles on it.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:55] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:05:55] Because people wrote in about this shirt to, Angela. Molly C. and Isaiah Johnson asked, "Where did Angela's Sprinkles' shirt come from and did you get to keep it"? You said you did not keep it.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:08] I did not keep it. And Carey made that shirt. She had that shirt made. And also when I had my wardrobe fitting for this, Carey and I talked and Angela would not be in shorts. She would not wear shorts. So that's why I have sort of those little cropped pants. And then at first, they had Keds for me. And I was like, "I can't run in Keds and I have to actually run. So-".



JENNA FISCHER [00:06:31] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:31] "I need an actual sneaker".



JENNA FISCHER [00:06:32] There you go.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:34] There you go.



JENNA FISCHER [00:06:34] Well, Carey told me about those blue shirts, the famous blue shirts with all the writing on them. So she designed those. We made them ourselves. She said that she just tried to imagine Michael getting on the phone and ordering those T-shirts with the ridiculously long name and insisting that all the words be on the shirt. Which I think is a very funny way to approach that design.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:07:02] I mean, I thought it was perfect. And honestly, while we're talking about the shirt. What the heck kind of budget did they have for this? Not only did they have bracelets and those T-shirts, they had fliers and banners. They had a giant Meredith photo poster, and a giant check!



JENNA FISCHER [00:07:22] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:07:23] What was their budget?



JENNA FISCHER [00:07:23] I mean, we're going to see when we get to that scene in the conference room that we spend quite a bit of our donation money just throwing the Fun Run. Carey also told me that she chose the color blue for the shirts because everybody had to wear it. And blue looks good on everyone. She said she always applies the same logic for photo shoots and promo shoots. Blue just looks best.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:07:44] That's right.



JENNA FISCHER [00:07:45] Well, let's talk about Dwight. Fan question from Ella Lewis, "Why isn't Dwight wearing a Fun Run shirt? I feel like he would have been the most likely to support Michael's ideas, yet he's wearing a Schrute Farms shirt instead". I think it makes perfect sense that he would self advertise.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:08:02] I agree with Ella. I was surprised that Dwight would not just champion Michael the way he does.



JENNA FISCHER [00:08:08] Carey told me that she made this shirt. She literally just used a standard stencil and she spray painted it in that parking lot right before we started shooting. But after the episode aired, NBC marketing department got so many requests for that shirt that they called her and asked her for her art files so that they could mass produce it and sell it. And Carey was like, "Don't have an art file. Just-".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:08:34] "Have a, have a spray painty thing that I made in the parking lot".



JENNA FISCHER [00:08:38] Yeah. "Just did-".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:08:39] "If you want to come get my spray paint stencil".



JENNA FISCHER [00:08:42] Yeah, she was like, "Um, OK". All right, well, our final question about the clothing comes from Ian M. P. and Marina Blank, they're asking, "Is Michael wearing women's shorts for 'Fun Run'"?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:08:59] Oh, man, there definitely some kind of, like, biker short with, like, the little windbreaker short over it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:09:06] Yeah, Carey says, "No". They were not women's shorts. She said, "The thing with Steve was that he's actually really fit". And Angela, you and I know this. He was really, really into fitness.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:20] Well, he got into great shape. We've talked about that for "40-Year-Old-Virgin", and then he has just made that part of his lifestyle. And I think in this episode, when he gets in his shorts and his T-shirt, you can see how fit he is.



JENNA FISCHER [00:09:34] Yes.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:34] There's no hiding how fit he is.



JENNA FISCHER [00:09:36] He has like zero percent body fat.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:39] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:09:39] And it's very clear. Carey said, "It was really a challenge to make him look like Michael any time he was out of his sort of frumpy Michael suit because he just was in such great shape". She said it was just kind of difficult. So there you go.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:56] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:09:56] That is a Costume Breakdown.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:10:00] I like it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:10:01] Thank you so much.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:10:02] I like it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:10:03] All right, Fast Fact Number Three. As you know in this episode, Jim and Pam do not run. A lot of people run. But Jim and Pam do not, they walk. They go to an estate sale.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:10:17] Jim and Pam don't run, and Oscar and Stanley and Creed take a cab. But Jim and Pam do not run. They walk in the back. They hold hands.



JENNA FISCHER [00:10:28] Well, there was a reason for this.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:10:29] I know.



JENNA FISCHER [00:10:30] The reason for this is because in May of 2007, we shot this in August. In May, I fell down a set of stairs in New York City and I fractured four bones in my back and I was not allowed to run. So the writers had to write a reason for me to only walk through this episode.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:10:57] That was such a scary night. I was with you.



JENNA FISCHER [00:11:00] I know you were.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:11:01] That was so scary.



JENNA FISCHER [00:11:03] Yeah. So here's what happened. It was May and we were in New York and we were promoting "The Office". We were promoting the Season Finale. And they threw this big party, in quotes, "party", it was a work event at this club called Buddakan.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:11:18] Yeah. It was our job to kind of hobnob with advertisers and stuff. It was, we were at work, but it was a fancy work.



JENNA FISCHER [00:11:26] Yes. So we're all dressed up and this club is two floors, so you enter on the upper floor. They had this little bar with drinks and they were serving these like pineapple-y daiquiri things. And it was sweet. And I was like, this seems great. So I grabbed one. But then to get to kind of the main part of the event, you had to go down this long set of stairs that were marble.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:11:52] And they were steep, you guys, they had a really deep pitch to them.

-

JENNA FISCHER [00:11:57] Yeah, they're still there. This club is still there. So I'm walking down these stairs. I've basically just arrived. I've taken one sip of my little daiquiri and something happens. My foot slips out from underneath me and I go crashing down on the edge of these stairs hard. To add insult to injury, I also threw my drink in my own face. So that was fun. So I'm sitting on the ground, I'm half covered in daiquiri, and I immediately start to feel like I'm going to vomit or everything gets dizzy and I remember this bouncer comes over and picked me up and he was treating me like I was like a boozy drunken Hollywood starlet, like he was in no way regarding me with much care. It was like, "Get her out of there, get the boozer out". And I was like, "I'm not. I don't". But I was all disoriented, you know? So I remember they took me back to the store room, Angela, and you were there and I told you I didn't feel good. And I remember you lifted up the back of my shirt and you said, "Call an ambulance".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:13:10] Well, I was behind you on that staircase and I saw you go down. It happened in slow motion. Someone had spilled their drink or something on those stairs, and they were marble and they were slick. And you, you had these wedge shoes on, you turned your ankle and you went down so hard. And, you know, when you're the person watching something happen, how you're like, "Nooo-", like I didn't know how to stop it. It was all in motion. And yeah, I'll never forget that night because your back was, it looked bad. And yeah, I was, I was scared.



JENNA FISCHER [00:13:43] Well, I don't remember much else after that. I don't remember the ambulance ride. But I know you were with me, Ang. And I remember going in and out at the hospital and you were by my side the whole time, lady.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:13:54] I know.



JENNA FISCHER [00:13:55] You were there. And I remember they X-rayed me. I remember you told me the guy in the bed next to me was handcuffed to his bed?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:06] There was a guy in a chair next to your bed and they brought him in. He was real surly and they handcuffed him to the chair. And I shut the little curtain around your bed because-.



JENNA FISCHER [00:14:19] Oh, dear.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:19] And also, I was staying with you and I was really adamant about it. You know, I was like, "She has no family here. You, I am not like going anywhere. She's in an emergency room in a city that's not her own. She has no family. And I. You are stuck with me, buddy". So they, they didn't mess with me. And I stayed with you till 4:00 in the morning. We got you a hospital room and we knew more details then. And once we got you set up in your room, I went, I was supposed to be on "The Today Show" that morning with Rainn Wilson. We were supposed to be interviewed for "The Office" and they had a whole piece about Dwight and Angela. And I asked NBC, you know, I was like, "I'm supposed to be on the air in an hour, but I'm in a hospital room with my friend. I can't, I can't be there". And they said, "Don't worry, we'll let 'The Today Show' know". So years later, I'm at the White House Correspondents Dinner. I'm sitting at the NBC "Today Show" table. And we talk about, we're just talking about, "Oh, when was the last time we saw you"? And they were like, "You were supposed to do 'The Today Show' with Rainn Wilson. You were a no show". And I was like, "What? I wasn't a no show. I was with Jenna in a hospital, didn't they tell you that"? They never told them. I just didn't-.



JENNA FISCHER [00:15:38] They never told them why you didn't show up?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:41] No.



JENNA FISCHER [00:15:41] They just thought you were like a flaky actress. This night branded me in this bouncer's eyes as some boozed up actress. And then "The Today Show", the next day, thought you were a flake. And we were like, "No! Tragedy. Tragedy happened".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:56] Yeah. Yeah. And I've done "The Today Show" now since, but I was like, how many years did they just think I didn't show up?



JENNA FISCHER [00:16:03] Oh, my gosh. Well, you know, I'll never forget the doctor coming in. And he said, "The good news is you're gonna walk again".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:16:14] Oh, my God.



JENNA FISCHER [00:16:14] And I was like, "That's the go-"? I mean, that is good news, but that sounds like there's a lot of bad news coming.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:16:23] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:16:23] So as it turns out, I had fractured four of the transverse vertebrae in my back. If you're going to have a back injury, I guess this is the best one because they heal on their own, similar to a broken rib. And motion is the best thing for you. So even though walking and moving was really difficult for me, I was encouraged to do it. Here's a crazy twist to the story. You know, NBC had put us up at the Ritz Carlton. For these two days that we were going to do press, they had to deal with the hotel and the entire cast was put up at the Ritz Carlton. And remember, lady, we asked for adjoining rooms.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:01] And we were so excited. Talk about country mouse come to town. We're at the Ritz facing Central Park.



JENNA FISCHER [00:17:10] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:10] Two whole nights. We were so excited.



JENNA FISCHER [00:17:13] Well, I couldn't go home. I couldn't leave. So NBC had to pay for me to live at the Ritz Carlton for two weeks.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:24] And guess what?



JENNA FISCHER [00:17:26] What?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:27] For the first week, I was with you the whole time.



JENNA FISCHER [00:17:29] I know you didn't leave my side.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:31] I didn't leave your side because you had family on the way. But, you know, they needed a few days to get there. And so I was there and I just remember that time. And, you know, I think every friendship has these milestone moments that you're forever bonded by. And we've certainly had a few and best friends listening to this out there, you know those moments. This was one of those moments when you're helping your friend get on the toilet.



JENNA FISCHER [00:17:59] Yep.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:59] And Jenna, you did this for me after my C-section. You helped me. Like I remember this. These were, this was one of those BFF moments.



JENNA FISCHER [00:18:09] We have both been with the other while one has had a catheter.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:14] Yeah. "Do you need your friend to step out while I give you this catheter? Nah, she can stay".



JENNA FISCHER [00:18:20] "No, I actually prefer to hold her hand please".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:23] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:18:25] "I'd, I'd like someone here with me".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:27] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:18:27] Yeah. So anybody out there, if you're wondering why Angela and I are best friends and will be best friends forever, friends who catheter together stay together. All right?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:38] Oh man.



JENNA FISCHER [00:18:40] Oh. My final piece of this story is simply that I couldn't shower for several days and my hair was so smelly. I'm sorry you had to live with that, Ang. That pineapple, it really turned real gross. And-.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:54] I did wet, I did wet a wash rag and try to dampen your hair with the wash rag.



JENNA FISCHER [00:19:00] Yeah. You did. You did. But anyway, guys, that's why Pam doesn't run in this episode. I was healed, but I don't think at this point I was driving myself yet and I wasn't allowed to run.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:12] Your doctor had you on a very specific sort of recovery plan because you do not mess with the back.



JENNA FISCHER [00:19:20] No.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:20] You don't mess around.



JENNA FISCHER [00:19:21] But I'm fully healed now. No problems. No, no residual problems.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:26] Well, I loved the storyline for Jim and Pam. I thought it made it just really sweet, like they just, they were just going to hang out. They weren't going to participate. And then they had this sort of lovely walk and they got to hold hands. And I thought it worked out great.



JENNA FISCHER [00:19:41] It worked.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:42] It worked.



JENNA FISCHER [00:19:44] Well, guys, thanks for listening to us go down that memory lane. We'll take a break and we'll be back to really dive into this episode. OK, we are back. This episode opens with Pam answering the phone. "Michael Scott's Dunder Mifflin Scranton Meredith Palmer Memorial Celebrity Rabies Awareness Fun Run Race for the Cure". But it's, you know, it's the Pro-Am Race for the Cure.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:12] My favorite thing about that whole moment was how you delivered, "They hung up". It's so good. It's so good.



JENNA FISCHER [00:20:23] Well, we got some fan questions about this from Gabriel B., Frank S., Kaylos D., Alberto R., and Camil Y. "Jenna, did you have to memorize that long title for the Fun Run Race for the Cure? Or did you look at a piece of paper every time you said it"? No, you guys, I had to memorize that, but I did have it sitting on a piece of paper in front of me, like, I would look at it intensely because that is a mouthful. That is a lot to have to say.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:51] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:20:51] But I did memorize it for that scene.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:53] And, and it's a mouthful that doesn't make sense. Like for me, I can memorize something. If it makes sense, my brain will piece it together for me. But if it's just like a list you have to work at it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:21:04] Yeah. That is more difficult, for sure.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:08] Like I, there's no way I could have ever been one of those doctors on "E.R." or whatever, like on "Gray's Anatomy" where they're running down the hallway and they got someone on the stretcher and they're like, "We need three BPUs and the, get the suture sewn up".



JENNA FISCHER [00:21:26] I think that all the time when I watch those shows. All the time, I think, like they're just yelling out jargon.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:33] They have no idea what they're saying.



JENNA FISCHER [00:21:35] Yes.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:36] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:21:36] Well, then Michael has an amazing talking head that I really love where he lets us know that a woman should not have to be hit by a car to learn that she has rabies. But here we are.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:47] Well, you know what, Michael is there fighting for women once again.



JENNA FISCHER [00:21:51] Yes, exactly. Well, then we go out into the bullpen. We're panning around. People are, I guess, on the phones kind of phone banking, trying to get donations for this cause.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:04] He has the whole office doing this. It's unbelievable that any of us had a job after this day. And I love that he walked up and said, "Hi Stankley". Like, when is Michael going to learn? You can't do bits with Stanley. Stanley doesn't want your bits.



JENNA FISCHER [00:22:22] He doesn't. He is, Stanley is a bit free person.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:25] Yeah. Don't bring your bits to Stanley.



JENNA FISCHER [00:22:27] Well, Phyllis is hard at work on the rabies' quilt. She holds it up.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:31] How many quilts does this company make? I mean, I felt like this was a callback to the Depression quilt from "Safety Training". Any wonder Dwight was like, "Should we do a depression quilt"? And Michael's like, "No, no time to sew the quilt". Because clearly it's a thing.



JENNA FISCHER [00:22:45] It's a thing.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:46] Put Phyllis on it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:22:48] Well, we had a fan question from Mary Halsy, "Who made the rabies quilt"? Well, guys, it was Phil Shea. I mean, he didn't personally make it, but he had to get someone to make those squares. And if you want to buy it, there is a full size version of the quilt online. Just Google it.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:05] Get out, get out.



JENNA FISCHER [00:23:07] Rabies' Quilt, "The Office". People are making them. You can buy them.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:10] I have got to Google that. I want to see it. You know, my mom's a quilter. You know?



JENNA FISCHER [00:23:14] Yes! Angela, in my notes for today, I literally wrote, "Angela, your mom quilts". I have several pieces of your mom's quilting.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:23] My mom is old school type of quilter where, you know, no machine, she cuts out all the pieces and then she, like, makes her, her pattern. She'll use like one of the bedrooms in the house and then she sews that all by hand. And she'll do the backing sometimes, you know, with the machine.



JENNA FISCHER [00:23:42] Mmhmm.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:42] But she actually purchased in Pennsylvania years and years ago from an Amish family, a wooden quilt rack. And every peg, everything is wooden.



JENNA FISCHER [00:23:53] Wow.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:53] There's no metal screws or anything. And she puts her quilt top on there and quilts. And I feel like every single one is a piece of art.



JENNA FISCHER [00:24:01] Since we're talking about quilting, I want to bring up this artist that I love, Bisa Butler. She makes these huge life-size quilted portraits that I'm slightly obsessed with. Go to her Instagram page. It's at BisaButler. They look like paintings, but they're not.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:24:21] I'm going to look at it right now.



JENNA FISCHER [00:24:23] OK, look at it.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:24:24] Oh, my gosh. They're beautiful.



JENNA FISCHER [00:24:28] Yeah, I just love her work, lady. I love it. I can't wait to see it in person one day. I love it.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:24:33] It's beautiful. It's art.



JENNA FISCHER [00:24:35] It's gorgeous. And she was featured in the New York Times as well. She had this, I mean, she's all over the place. She's a big deal. But check it out. BisaButler on Instagram.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:24:44] Well, you know, we're about to move on to an Andy talking head here about nipple chafing.



JENNA FISCHER [00:24:51] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:24:51] But did you notice Andy is now sitting at Karen's desk?



JENNA FISCHER [00:24:55] I did.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:24:56] And also we didn't mention this last week. But when Karen cleared out, did she take the company phone and the computer? Like everything was gone.



JENNA FISCHER [00:25:06] Everything. It was all gone. Yeah, well, we had a fan question about Andy's nipple chafing from Lindsey L. who said, "Who came up with the nipple chafing idea? Was it based off of a personal experience"? Well, Greg told me that this was an idea from Justin Spitzer, so I asked him about it and he said, yes, this was his idea, and that he had once handed out waters and blankets to runners who were finishing the Chicago Marathon. And he could not believe how many men were crossing the finish line with blotches of blood on their shirts over their nipples from nipple chafing. He said it, sort of, it shocked him and haunted him, and he had been obsessed with it ever since, and he was finally able to ride it into an episode.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:26:00] Well-.



JENNA FISCHER [00:26:00] So I think this was very healing for him.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:26:03] It's a real-.



JENNA FISCHER [00:26:03] He was able to take this experience and turn it into art.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:26:06] Well, it's a real thing. And of course, I looked it up. Jenna, it's also called "Jogger's Nipple".



JENNA FISCHER [00:26:13] Oh.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:26:14] I had no idea it was such a thing and it's more common in the winter because nipples are erect then.



JENNA FISCHER [00:26:21] Uh huh.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:26:21] But there's many ways to prevent it. And one of them is sort of like covering them like this. And there are all kinds of companies that make these. And now there's nipple covers for women, like when you don't want your nipples to show on clothing. You know, we've had wardrobe fittings where sometimes they're like, "Oh, we might need to put something there".



JENNA FISCHER [00:26:39] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:26:39] But there's, there's a whole other industry for men. And, you know, I love, I love a good name, Jenna, for businesses. I love it. So we've got, a few that I found were NipEAZE, Mr Nip, Nip Strips.



JENNA FISCHER [00:26:55] Oh wow. Well, I imagine, I guess, because men have hairier chests like what I noticed when Ed was like covering his nipples was I just kept thinking what happens when he tries to take that off because of the hair? Will these companies solve that problem for me, I guess? If I'm a man.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:27:14] I don't know. I don't know.



JENNA FISCHER [00:27:16] Mr. Nip, was that one of them?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:27:18] Mr. Nip and Nip Strips. NipEAZE.



JENNA FISCHER [00:27:21] Maybe the Nip Strips?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:27:23] Well, I remember talking to Ed about, like those, that tape and cotton ball thing that he had to do and he said I was really uncomfortable. Like this was not a comfortable episode for him.



JENNA FISCHER [00:27:39] I imagine. I don't doubt it. I don't doubt it. Well, lady, now Andy is going to tell Angela how very sorry he is that her cat passed away.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:27:50] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:27:50] This might be leading her maybe toward Andy?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:27:53] Yeah, you know, there's a deleted scene where Dwight and Angela are exchanging instant messages and Dwight's trying to make amends and Angela is not having it. And she's getting fed up and she looks over her shoulder towards Dwight, and Andy is directly behind him and he thinks Angela is looking at him.



JENNA FISCHER [00:28:11] Oh.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:11] So I think they're planting little seeds here.



JENNA FISCHER [00:28:15] Well, now you have a talking head, Angela, where you are crying.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:20] Mmhmm.



JENNA FISCHER [00:28:21] And you're talking about how Sprinkles was your best friend and you're sharing pictures of Sprinkles. Because you're, including one from the last Halloween.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:33] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:28:33] Where you're just a couple of kittens out on the town.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:36] Couple of kittens out on the town.



JENNA FISCHER [00:28:38] Well, lady, we got some mail about this.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:40] Yes, about the photos?



JENNA FISCHER [00:28:42] Yes. From Kate Sieber, Mandy Pascale and Anne Marie Morrison. "Did you have to do a photo shoot or did they just Photoshop a cat into your arms"?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:56] Well, I did a little bit of both. So if you'll notice a few of the photos, like in particular, there's the picnic blanket one. I'm laying on a picnic blanket. There's a bowl of grapes and I'm holding the cat. If you notice, I'm wearing my outfit from "Beach Games".



JENNA FISCHER [00:29:12] Oh, yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:13] Right? So-.



JENNA FISCHER [00:29:14] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:15] There's a few photos of me in my "Beach Games" outfit. Well, Phil Shea pulled me aside and was like, "Angela, we're, we're going to need some photos of you with Sprinkles for an upcoming episode". So that day where we started out for "Beach Games" on the bus, in the parking lot.



JENNA FISCHER [00:29:29] Mmhmm.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:29] Phil Shea just said, "Angela, I'm gonna grab you when I can and we'll just quickly take these. OK"? So the day that we started "Beach Games", before we went to the beach, you know, when we were still leaving Dunder Mifflin, I snuck off with Phil Shea and we took a bunch of those. And I walked over in my own flip flops and you can see them in the photo. That's why I'm barefoot. Isn't that weird? That Angela Martin would be barefoot with a pair of flip flops and you can see a little eagle on the flip flops because they're American Eagle. They're my American Eagle flip flops.



JENNA FISCHER [00:30:00] That is incredible. Well, I loved you in this talking head so much. You're so good in this whole episode, Ang.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:30:07] Oh, thanks. Thanks so much. Well, up next, Jenna, we have the scene, it starts at 24:02. And I titled this scene, "The Moment the Crew Turned on Us". Sam, can you play this?



ANGELA MARTIN [00:30:23] I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you'd be able to give me some advice.



PAM BEESLY [00:30:30] What's wrong?



ANGELA MARTIN [00:30:31] I have this crazy thought, that I know it's crazy, that maybe Dwight killed my cat.



PAM BEESLY [00:30:40] Mmm.



ANGELA MARTIN [00:30:40] When I got home. Sprinkles' body was in the freezer where Dwight said he left her, but all my bags of frozen French fries had been clawed to shreds.



PAM BEESLY [00:30:49] Oh.



ANGELA MARTIN [00:30:50] Something's not right. The vet is doing an autopsy.



PAM BEESLY [00:30:53] Angela, I'm sorry.



ANGELA MARTIN [00:30:54] Did Roy ever killed one of your cats?



PAM BEESLY [00:30:57] I'm more of a dog person.



ANGELA MARTIN [00:31:03] Ah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:04] Um. Jenna, do you remember us doing that scene?



JENNA FISCHER [00:31:06] Yes.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:07] We got to break it down for people because literally the director came over and was like, "I'm just going to stop you right now".



JENNA FISCHER [00:31:15] It was Greg.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:16] I know. I know. So I had to pop up over the partition. And I start off with like, Psst". And then you come-.



JENNA FISCHER [00:31:23] That got me, right there, I was done. I just started laughing just from your head popping over the partition, started laughing. No words have come out yet.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:33] And every single time you started laughing, then I would start laughing. And then there were times I would get it together and I'd come up over the partition and you'd already be laughing.



JENNA FISCHER [00:31:42] Yeah. Because I knew what was, I knew there, Angela, you have to imagine from my point of view what it's like to have your tiny blond head pop up suddenly. It's very funny. And we should also mention this scene was scheduled right before lunch.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:59] Yes. And everyone was really hungry.



JENNA FISCHER [00:32:02] You're always really hungry before lunch because you get called in to work at 5:00 a.m., 6:00 a.m. but lunch is not until 1:00. So you are hangry at 12:40. Everybody on a set is super hangry at 12:40. Even though there's snacks. You want to sit down, you want your 30 minute break, you want to eat a hot meal. And here you have these two actresses who cannot even get one line out.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:27] These two gals who are literally laughing so hard they can't speak.



JENNA FISCHER [00:32:32] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:32] And Greg was like, "Why don't we take a break? Why don't we give you guys a minute to get it together"? And I said, "Oh no, Jenna, they're turning on us". And like-.



JENNA FISCHER [00:32:42] I felt so bad because normally when we would break in a scene, the crew was laughing with you.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:48] And other actors would laugh too, and be like, "You guys".



JENNA FISCHER [00:32:52] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:52] No one was laughing.



JENNA FISCHER [00:32:53] No, it was just us. We were so tickled to have a scene together. We always were. And this was a comedic scene we got to do. This was funny.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:03] Yeah. And I'm surprised we even have one take that's usable because we were laughing so hard. And now, let's just take a minute to talk about Happy Pam Sass, because Happy Pam doesn't give Angela anything. She's like, "Mmm", "Oh", "Mmm". Can you imagine Angela finally reaching out to Pam and all she gets is, "Mmm", "Ah", "Well, I'm more of a dog person"? Are you flippin’ kidding me?



JENNA FISCHER [00:33:29] Well, Angela, what do you expect? Any time Pam has ever tried to comfort or help Angela, Angela just insults her. I think Pam is being self protective. She's having good boundaries, in my opinion.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:40] She's got good boundaries and she's getting laid. And she doesn't have time for anybody, anymore.



JENNA FISCHER [00:33:44] Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That is private. Well, Angela, I will say this, we have a fan soapbox, and I think you're going to like it.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:57] Ooh, I want to hear it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:33:59] This is from Amy Wagner, Rivka Wasserman, Kayla Kelley, Kaylen White and Christina Chadbourne. They all wrote in to say this, "I hate to break it to you, but Pam is actually responsible for the death of Sprinkles and the breakup of Dwangela. Pam guilts Angela into seeing Meredith at lunch instead of taking care of Sprinkles, which is why Angela has to ask Dwight to do it and why Sprinkles ends up dead".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:34:31] Oh, my gosh, ladies, I had never put that together! You are right, Pam killed Sprinkles.



JENNA FISCHER [00:34:41] Well, that's going a little far. But-.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:34:44] Pam, Pam killed Sprinkles.



JENNA FISCHER [00:34:45] Oh, my gosh, you are so mad at Pam right now. Pam is just happy. Why when Pam gets happy does everyone turn on her? That's something I've noticed, by the way. When Pam becomes assertive, there, in particular, are a bunch of men on Twitter who tweet about how they don't like Pam sassy. Nobody likes Assertive Pam. Well, everyone, you're going to have to live with it.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:11] I don't give a crap about Assertive Pam. It's Sassy Pam, Guilt Trip Pam, I-Don't-Give-A-Shit Pam, that I have issue with.



JENNA FISCHER [00:35:19] Well, I thought you'd like that fan soapbox.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:22] I very much like it, ladies. Thank you, I feel seen.



JENNA FISCHER [00:35:26] Well, speaking of Jim and Pam, they're flirting in the break room right now.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:30] Oh, I titled this scene. Ready?



JENNA FISCHER [00:35:34] What is it?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:35] Part two of our country song. "Ain't No More Heartbreak in the Break Room, Baby".



JENNA FISCHER [00:35:41] Oh, yes, yes. Happy times in the break room, everyone.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:47] It's happy times.



JENNA FISCHER [00:35:48] Well, the camera crew breaks the fourth wall and they bring Jim and Pam into the conference room and show them footage.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:59] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:35:59] Of them kissing and driving away. This is huge. Why is the documentary crew getting involved? Remember, they left Andy floating in a lake. But they pulled Jim and Pam aside to show them this footage.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:14] They didn't say, "Meredith, get out of the way".



JENNA FISCHER [00:36:18] I don't think they saw Meredith. They were focused on Michael. I don't think the documentary crew could have stopped that accident.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:27] You know? I mean, there's been many times where they probably should have stepped in and they didn't. Why now?



JENNA FISCHER [00:36:34] I don't know. But they get Pam to admit that she and Jim are dating.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:39] This is another Pam Sass moment where she doesn't care. She's like, "You know what? We're dating".



JENNA FISCHER [00:36:45] This is such a cute scene.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:46] It's so cute.



JENNA FISCHER [00:36:48] It has all the feels.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:49] It's really cute. And you and John are so good in it. It's a really great Jam. Jam moment.



JENNA FISCHER [00:36:56] Well, we had a fan question from Lynia B. who said, "What was it like coming back from the break between Season 3 and 4 to a new relationship between Jim and Pam"? You guys, it was awesome. I had a great time in Season 4. Pam was happy, I was happy. I just spent all day being happy in a comedy, basically. Because, I don't know about you, Angela, but I was going to ask you, you have to play this season in a lot of emotional turmoil and mourning and it takes a toll when you have to play jealousy or you have to play sad, like it does take a toll.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:40] Well, it does. Playing sad takes a toll. Playing angry is fun.



JENNA FISCHER [00:37:47] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:47] I will say that because I loved the juxtaposition from this very sweet, cute moment with Jim and Pam to me body checking Dwight by the file cabinet.



JENNA FISCHER [00:37:58] Yes.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:59] It's so great. And that whole scene that I have with Rainn over by accounting where I'm backing my chair into him. We had such a great time with that. That was so much fun.



JENNA FISCHER [00:38:10] Well, that is a really good scene. Dwight seems to think you're going to feel better after you run the 5K because exercise helps with depression and you're just like, "You're not getting it. I'm not depressed".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:22] I'm pissed off.



JENNA FISCHER [00:38:24] You're grieving.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:25] I'm grieving and I'm angry.



JENNA FISCHER [00:38:27] Yes. So now we go into the conference room, Angela. Jim, Michael, Pam and Dwight are putting sort of the finishing touches on the Fun Run plans. And Michael wants a giant check.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:41] What is his thing with giant checks? He, he got a giant check in "Product Recall".



JENNA FISCHER [00:38:46] Yeah, I don't know.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:47] I think, I swear, I think it goes back to when he was a little kid and that owl came to his assembly in a costume with props. This is how you get people's attention, how you get them to care about things. You have big props and costumes and outfits.



JENNA FISCHER [00:39:04] Why have we not explored Michael's feelings about Carrot Top? The most famous prop comic.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:13] I think he loves Carrot Top and I think he loves, who's the guy that hit all the watermelons?



JENNA FISCHER [00:39:17] Gallagher.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:18] Gallagher.



JENNA FISCHER [00:39:19] Yeah, I think you're right. Well, here's what he wants. He wants a giant check, even though it will eat up 25% of their funds. He wants a rabies doctor to present the check.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:32] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:39:34] Jim suggests maybe they hire a nurse like by the hour, like you would for a party. Michael's like, "Sounds great". Dwight suggests they just donate the money to Meredith's son's college fund.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:48] Dwight is the only person making sense in this meeting.



JENNA FISCHER [00:39:52] Yes, surprisingly, Dwight has the best idea. Jim and Pam are just egging Michael on.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:58] But Michael's like, "Have you seen that kid? He's not going to college".



JENNA FISCHER [00:40:01] Exactly.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:40:02] Well, I think we should take a break here, Jenna. And when we come back, we might need to talk about a dangling participle.



JENNA FISCHER [00:40:08] It's an accidental flashing.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:40:10] He did say, "Come in".



JENNA FISCHER [00:40:13] I agree.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:40:14] Yes.



JENNA FISCHER [00:40:14] All right. We'll be back. All right, we are back and Pam's about to get the shock of her life.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:40:24] Jenna, how did you film this? How did? OK, so, so Pam is, you know, like going in to tell Michael something, right?



JENNA FISCHER [00:40:31] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:40:31] She knocks on the door-.



JENNA FISCHER [00:40:32] She wants to tell him that 5K means five kilometers, not five thousand miles.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:40:37] Right. Right. And, and he says, "Come in", and she opens the door and he's decided to change into his running outfit in his office.



JENNA FISCHER [00:40:46] Yeah. And he is nude from the waist down. And Pam is shocked. Well, this was a really interesting scene to film. We had a fan question from Tara Nunez. "When Pam walks in on Michael naked, what was Steve actually wearing"? Steve was actually wearing like a flesh colored Speedo.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:41:06] It's still not pleasant to look at, guys. Those reactions are honest. Whenever anyone has to wear a flesh covered anything, it's just off putting.



JENNA FISCHER [00:41:16] Yeah, you kind of look like a, like a Ken doll or a Barbie doll or something.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:41:21] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:41:21] It's very weird. You still are seeing-.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:41:23] Outlines.



JENNA FISCHER [00:41:23] Right. Anyway, the thing that was difficult here when we were shooting it, and we shot this several times, because Pam has to get far enough into the room and open the door wide enough that the camera can see Michael, because in my early takes of this, I can see him, but the camera wasn't catching it because I was reacting too quickly.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:41:47] You're pulling the door shut too fast.



JENNA FISCHER [00:41:49] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:41:49] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:41:50] So the first thing that we did was Greg said, "Why don't you be looking at the paper longer and like, give a look to camera as you're opening the door. Like, 'Can you believe he thinks it's five thousand miles'"? So that I can get the door open wider for camera to see him almost before I see him. So that's how we ended up fixing that problem, but it was very, very funny. We were laughing a lot during this scene.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:42:18] Lady, after this aired, a friend of mine and I were talking about this episode, and I'll never forget it because I heard a term I'd never heard before in my life. And they said, this is, this is a thing sometimes guys will do. I don't know where they do it, but it's called "shirt cocking".



JENNA FISCHER [00:42:38] Oh.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:42:38] And it's a thing. OK, and if you look it up, it says it's a, "shirt cocking" is a verb and it's when a man wears a T-shirt but goes naked from the waist down. Oh, oh! Listen to this. "This practice is a natural outgrowth of Burning Man events which value radical self-expression, but are held in clothing optional environments".



JENNA FISCHER [00:43:01] Oh. I've never been to Burning Man.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:05] Well, neither have I, but apparently this happens there, guys.



JENNA FISCHER [00:43:10] Well, I've never been shirt cocked either.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:12] I've never, I, I've never been shirt cocked, but beware, it's happens.



JENNA FISCHER [00:43:18] It's a thing.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:19] I guess it's a thing in, in the desert, guys, where people get together to have radical experiences.



JENNA FISCHER [00:43:26] Well, Michael shirt cocks Pam. And Pam tells Jim that the incident is now burned into her brain.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:35] Back in the break room, Jim and Pam don't hang out at front reception anymore. They just go to the break room to hang out and have their little conversations.



JENNA FISCHER [00:43:43] Yeah, happiness in the break room. The break room is a great place now. Well, Michael knocks on the break room door and enters. He's trying to teach Pam how to properly enter a room.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:54] "Oh, can I come in"?



JENNA FISCHER [00:43:56] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:57] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:43:58] And Pam is, like, "You said, 'Come in'. You said, 'Come in'".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:03] Well, Pam has a major Pam Sass moment. She says, "I didn't see where it started, but I saw where it ended".



JENNA FISCHER [00:44:12] Wow.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:13] I couldn't believe that line.



JENNA FISCHER [00:44:14] Wow. Pam is really just saying anything on her mind now. You're really, I-.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:20] See?



JENNA FISCHER [00:44:20] You're right. Yeah. She's looking up celebrity porn on the computer. She's sassing Angela. She's sassing Michael.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:30] She's not going to run in your stupid Fun Run.



JENNA FISCHER [00:44:33] It's true. Let's get to the Fun Run, lady.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:36] Let's do it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:44:37] We're in the parking lot. Jan is checking people in. Creed registers. He's very disappointed there's no prize money.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:45] We find out, by the way, that Creed's birthday is November 1st and he's going to be 82.



JENNA FISCHER [00:44:51] I know.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:52] What?



JENNA FISCHER [00:44:52] That was so ridiculous. That was so ridiculous.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:56] Jan tells Pam to stay away from her man. Heard she was peeping in on him.



JENNA FISCHER [00:45:00] I know. Oh, that was so fun to do. I love doing that scene with Melora where she's just putting Pam in her place, and Pam is like, "I, uh". But you know, guys, Jan is no longer our boss.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:45:12] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:45:13] She holds no authority over us. She is just there as Michael's girlfriend.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:45:18] Well, I have to tell you something. So all of this is happening, while you have this scene between Pam and Jan going on, there is a scene between Bob Vance, Phyllis and Angela. So in the background where Toby is stretching, Angela's standing there, and Phyllis and Bob walk up and Bob points to her shirt and says, "Oh, oh, is that, is that the cat"? And he turns to Phyllis and says, "Is that the one that Meredith-"? And Phyllis quickly cut some off and goes, "No, no, no". And then Angela spits on Bob.



JENNA FISCHER [00:45:52] What?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:45:52] And storms off.



JENNA FISCHER [00:45:54] What is happening in that scene? Did Meredith do something to one of your other cats?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:45:59] I have so many questions. What has Meredith done to one of her cats? It certainly might explain why Angela really does not like Meredith. But man, Angela is, talk about angry. She spits at Bob.



JENNA FISCHER [00:46:13] Wow.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:46:14] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:46:16] Well, now Michael welcomes everyone and he gives a speech where he sort of warns everybody of the dangers of rabies. In the background then, Darryl is feeding a peanut to a squirrel. It was such, that is such a random, funny joke. That's a very Simpsons esque joke, if you ask me.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:46:37] I loved it. And I love when Michael is like, "Stop". And he's like, "But he's so happy".



JENNA FISCHER [00:46:44] Well, then we have Elizabeth, the stripper, is back, Jackie Debatin, she walks in in this little nurse's outfit to present Michael with the giant check made out to science. Just science.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:00] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:47:01] 340 dollars to science.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:03] Just a piece of cardboard that cost 200 dollars for nothing.



JENNA FISCHER [00:47:07] And when Michael sees Elizabeth in her outfit, he's like, "Oh, my gosh, you went back for your degree".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:13] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:47:14] Amazing. Well, I have a little wardrobe tidbit.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:17] I think I know your tidbit.



JENNA FISCHER [00:47:19] Oh, really?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:20] Go.



JENNA FISCHER [00:47:20] All right. Carey told me that this nurse's outfit was custom made. And if you notice, she had to make it a red circle with a white cross in the middle. And this is because the Red Cross does not like their symbol to be used for fictional content, so she could not have a Red Cross in a white circle. She had to invert it.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:45] Yes, lady. Well, do you know that that is the same costume that Angela Martin wore in Season 7? They saved that costume. Season 7, the Halloween episode where we have a costume contest, I wore that outfit.



JENNA FISCHER [00:48:04] What?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:05] Yep, I wore that outfit, the exact same one, and it was a little too big for me, so I had to wear a little lace tank top underneath it and, you know, we'll, we'll get to Season 7. But they gave me the chicken cutlets to make everything a little bigger.



JENNA FISCHER [00:48:23] Yep.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:23] Same costume.



JENNA FISCHER [00:48:25] Wow, I guess in our Dunder Mifflin world, this is like a little costume that you could buy, I guess, but Carey Bennett told me that she made it. There it is. You're wearing it.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:38] And you can see, it's the same white cross, the same hat. I just have a tank top because it's a little big.



JENNA FISCHER [00:48:45] That is crazy.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:46] I know. It crazy.



JENNA FISCHER [00:48:48] Well, speaking of crazy, Michael is now downing some fettuccini Alfredo. Just downing it. He's carbo loading before the run.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:57] Oh.



JENNA FISCHER [00:48:58] Is that a thing? Do people carbo load? They do, but like not moments before they run. Right?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:04] I looked it up. There's two things happening in this moment. First of all, we have a fakey bag catch.



JENNA FISCHER [00:49:10] Yes.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:10] Fakey bag, fakey prop bag, that bag that Dwight is holding is not a real bag. It's one of the ones that doesn't make noise. And here's the thing about carbo loading. So, guys, this, this is something that people will do, but it's recommended that you do it the week before a hi-.



JENNA FISCHER [00:49:28] The week before.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:29] Yeah, a week before a high endurance activity. Yeah, the reason why you do this carbo load, the week before, is to boost the glycogen that's stored in your muscles. Right? So you can sort of burn on that while you're doing your high endurance activity. You don't do it minutes before.



JENNA FISCHER [00:49:49] It's so gross.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:51] So gross.



JENNA FISCHER [00:49:51] It's so gross. A lot of people wrote in asking how much fettuccini Steve had to eat. Pretty much none. I don't know if you noticed, but we cut away before he has to really swallow the fettuccini. They had a bucket there so he would shove a bunch in his mouth and he would spit it out.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:50:08] Thank God, because it was almost 100 degrees that week, every day.



JENNA FISCHER [00:50:11] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:50:11] And we were outside. Hot, outside, eating fettuccini. Bleh.



JENNA FISCHER [00:50:14] Can we talk about the ginormous gun that Dwight shoots off to start the race? Not a starter's pistol, an actual gun with actual bullets in it. Obviously, we shot off blanks, but what the heck?



ANGELA KINSEY [00:50:30] I know. So according to Dunderpedia, Dwight uses a six inch Colt Anaconda, and it's the same caliber gun used by Dirty Harry.



JENNA FISCHER [00:50:41] Well, it's ridiculous.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:50:42] I believe, though, that he would have some gun that Clint Eastwood fired. Like a Dirty Harry gun. That tracks.



JENNA FISCHER [00:50:48] It's perfect for his character. Well, the race is underway. We fired this gun, Creed, Stanley and Oscar immediately get into a cab.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:50:58] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:51:00] Which is amazing.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:51:01] Brilliant.



JENNA FISCHER [00:51:01] Stanley says, he will workout today, he will work out a way to avoid running for a stupid cause.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:51:07] Yeah, they all three have talking heads and deleted scenes that talk about why they're not doing it. Stanley had an alt that said when he runs, his feet swell up to the size of a pot roast, and you don't want to see that.



JENNA FISCHER [00:51:19] Oh. Well, Angela Martin certainly would not. She does not like gross feet.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:51:23] No.



JENNA FISCHER [00:51:24] Well, we sort of see everybody's approach, right? Like Andy's going to run. Michael's going really fast. And this is when we find out that Pam and Jim are happily in last place together, just strolling.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:51:35] Andy's going to draft behind Kevin.



JENNA FISCHER [00:51:38] Well, now we have a scene that I love so much where Jan is handing out water to the runners. She's somehow moved from the starting line where she was checking people in to a new table where she's handing out waters and people haven't even gotten to her yet. I found that interesting.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:51:57] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:51:57] She obviously drove, I guess, to this new spot.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:51:59] She quickly drove. Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:52:01] Well, Michael refuses to take the water. He explains that rabies victims have to live with an irrational hatred of water, so it's really the least he can do. To refuse the water. Well, I looked it up, Angela, you know last week, I told you a lot about rabies and the importance of getting a shot if you're ever bitten by an animal.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:52:20] Hey, I did not look it up. In fact, I wrote myself a note, "Ask Jenna, rabies expert, 'Is this true'"?



JENNA FISCHER [00:52:27] No, you did not. I, I have to say, I do know a lot more about rabies than I ever thought I would, thanks to this podcast. But this condition is called hydrophobia, and it is an irrational fear of water. And it does present itself in the advanced stages of the disease of rabies. But here's why. Basically, patients start to fear liquids because it is so painful to swallow.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:53:00] Oh.



JENNA FISCHER [00:53:01] Like they don't want to drink or eat anything. So it's not like having water touch them would bother them. But ingesting anything becomes so painful that that's why.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:53:14] This is horrible, this is horrible.



JENNA FISCHER [00:53:17] Rabies is a horrible disease, I cannot stress enough how important it is to get that shot if you are bitten by an animal.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:53:25] Wow. Well, we also didn't mention that Toby ran by and took a swig of water, but threw most of it on Jan.



JENNA FISCHER [00:53:31] Yes, this is true. Well, Toby is doing great and we're about to find out why.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:53:39] Mmhmm.



JENNA FISCHER [00:53:39] Michael is not doing well. Because of the fettuccini.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:53:44] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:53:45] But Dwight tells him, he's going to be fine, you'll probably still win because he put Imodium in Toby's coffee.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:53:52] Michael's so excited. He's like, "Excellent". And then goes, Wait, don't you mean Ex Lax"?



JENNA FISCHER [00:53:57] Yes. Dwight has helped Toby.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:54:00] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [00:54:01] I want to point something out about this scene. During this scene, I swear Michael and Dwight run past Oscar's house or at least the location that we used for Oscar's house. So I looked it up, and yes, we are filming on the same street in Sherman Oaks that has Oscar's house. We filmed there a lot. It was really close to our set. And yeah, I think we run past the location of Oscar's house.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:54:34] We film there a lot for all those reasons, and also this particular neighborhood in Sherman Oaks has really great old, old, huge trees that might resemble the East Coast more than normally what L.A. would look like.



JENNA FISCHER [00:54:50] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:54:51] Meanwhile, Andy's nipples are starting to chafe, and Creed, Stanley and Oscar are at like an outside cafe. They've ordered another round of drinks. I like their style.



JENNA FISCHER [00:55:01] Yes. And Pam and Jim are now going to stop at an estate sale.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:55:06] I love estate sales. My mom, this makes me think of my mom, whenever we went anywhere, any kind of road trip, if we saw a sign that said Yard Sale, Garage Sale, Estate Sale, my mom would literally pull off the road.



JENNA FISCHER [00:55:20] Well, in my sophomore year of college, I got my own apartment. And the summer before I went back to school, my mom took me around to Estate Sales and Garage Sales. And that's where I bought all of my dishes and my pots and pans and all the stuff I was going to need for my kitchen. And I still have some of that stuff. I still have a baking dish from one of the Garage Sales that we went to in order to get all my stuff for college.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:55:48] I still have a little piece of like kitchen art. It's like a pear and some grapes. And it's like someone made this, someone made the image and then got a piece of wood and then shellacked over it. Do you know what I mean?



JENNA FISCHER [00:56:02] Yes.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:56:02] And it's this sort of kitschy little piece of kitchen art. And I got it at a Garage Sale. I love that. I did that too.



JENNA FISCHER [00:56:11] I love Estate Sales and Garage Sales because I think there's such a great way to recycle and reuse.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:56:17] Mmhmm.



JENNA FISCHER [00:56:18] You know? You don't have to buy everything new. When someone's done with it, use it. I love that.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:56:26] I love that too, I always love the idea of what that story was. Like what, what did that green bowl with that one little chip, what was that about? Now I'm going to have it.



JENNA FISCHER [00:56:35] Yes, I agree.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:56:37] Well, now I love that Ryan and fancy corporate calls Dunder Mifflin, and no one is answering. And he gets this message that says, "You've reached the offices of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Currently, the entire staff is out doing the Michael Scott DMSMPMC Rabies Awareness Pro-Am Fun Run Race". And then Michael chimes in, that's all your voice, and Michael chimes in and goes, "For the cure". And then Pam says, "Leave a message". I thought it was hilarious. I thought it was so funny. And Ryan is like, "Ugh".



JENNA FISCHER [00:57:13] Well, you know, Michael was just hovering over Pam's shoulder as she created that outgoing message.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:57:19] Oh, my goodness. I would love to have seen how many like ways that he made her say it until they got it right.



JENNA FISCHER [00:57:25] Well, now, lady, Dwight is going to try to sweet talk Angela.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:57:30] He is, he runs up next to her, tells her she looks cute as a button. She's not, she's not into it. She doesn't want to hear it. And there were a lot of things that made this scene a little trickier than it looks. We had to deliver all of our dialog while running, but we couldn't run so fast that you would never see Steve who was positioned just behind us, in between us. We couldn't run too close to one another and we had to pace this out because the camera was getting us in the foreground and Michael in the background.



JENNA FISCHER [00:58:01] I imagine it was difficult. Also, we only had so much sidewalk.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:58:06] Well, we had a specific place we had to stop too, on the sidewalk, and we had to try to hit that same mark every time, because then we see the neighbor and we have this great moment that I love where, where we're like, "It's nothing". And Dwight's like, "I'm robbing her". And I'm like, "It's fine". And then at the same time, we're like, "It's nothing". And then we go right back to our conversation we were having.



JENNA FISCHER [00:58:25] Well, we had a fan question from Steph Bailey and Debbie K., kind of more of a statement, "Angela, for not being a runner, you have really great form".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:58:36] Do I?



JENNA FISCHER [00:58:37] I thought so too. I thought you were a very cute runner.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:58:41] Well, thank you. I mean, I ran cross-country in high school, you guys,, maybe somewhere in the back of my brain, it was still there.



JENNA FISCHER [00:58:48] Well, there you go. When were you running cross-country while also playing basketball and trombone? I don't understand.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:58:56] And tennis. And I was a cheerleader. I was busy in high school, Jenna. This was, my mom's attitude was, "If you're busy, you don't have time for trouble".



JENNA FISCHER [00:59:05] Well, you were busy.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:59:06] I was very busy.



JENNA FISCHER [00:59:08] I also want to read you this letter from Patrick Wright.



ANGELA KINSEY [00:59:12] OK.



JENNA FISCHER [00:59:12] Because I agree with Patrick. Here's what Patrick had to say. "I really wanted to express my respect for Angela as an actress, especially in this episode. She is a mixture of tragically funny and also just heartbreaking. She gives such a fabulous, nuanced performance throughout this entire episode. We as an audience truly feel for her hurt and anger throughout the story. And my heart broke as she runs away from Dwight with her adoration of the man she loves, but at the same time shattered. The performances from everyone in the cast was brilliant, as always, but I felt compelled to single out Angela for her marvelous acting".



ANGELA KINSEY [00:59:56] Aw, that is so nice. Thank you. I so appreciate that.



JENNA FISCHER [01:00:03] We really feel Angela being torn here. Because Dwight admits he killed Sprinkles, he mercy killed Sprinkles.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:00:12] And, you know, Dwight tried to do it in the kindest way and for all the right reasons in his mind, right?



JENNA FISCHER [01:00:20] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:00:20] In his perspective. And gave her antihistamines until she fell asleep. And, and then Angela's like, "But then she threw them up and she tried to claw her way out". And she's like, "Why didn't you talk to me about this first"?



JENNA FISCHER [01:00:34] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:00:34] Like, how was this not a conversation? If this was the solution you thought needed to happen, why not talk to me about this? And there are sad moments to this scene. And then there's these moments where obviously there's a joke written. But I have to say it really earnestly, like the, "Cat heaven is a beautiful place, but you don't get there if you're euthanized". You know?



JENNA FISCHER [01:00:55] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:00:56] And, but one of the notes Greg gave me was, "As you run away-", you know, Dwight's like reaching out for you. And I say, "You don't understand". And I kind of start to cry as I run away, and he's, he said, "You know, what Dwight isn't getting is that this is unforgivable for you".



JENNA FISCHER [01:01:20] Yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:01:21] "And you love this man. But he has severed this bond. You don't think you can be with him anymore, but Dwight doesn't know that yet, but you know it".



JENNA FISCHER [01:01:32] Well, I've had this happen in relationships where you're dating and you're so in love and the relationship is just all promise and optimism, and then something happens and the person reacts or acts in such a way that you realize there is a fundamental difference of values.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:01:56] Yeah. And she knows it and she knows she can't see him the same way. And it will take a very, very, very long time, as we know, for her to forgive him.



JENNA FISCHER [01:02:07] Yeah. Well, guess what? Jim and Pam bought a lamp.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:02:13] Just the base of a lamp.



JENNA FISCHER [01:02:15] Yeah, it was eight dollars and now Jim gets to carry it.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:02:19] It's an odd choice, this green lamp. It looks like two octopus tentacles are holding hands or something, I don't know what's happening with it.



JENNA FISCHER [01:02:29] How does Jim feel about Pam's taste if this is the lamp she wanted to buy? Is he concerned about moving in together one day, maybe sharing a house? This lamp is not great. But also, Michael is really struggling. Phyllis and Bob passed him up.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:02:45] I mean, he's laying on the ground. His lips are all white. He doesn't look good.



JENNA FISCHER [01:02:50] He doesn't look like he's going to make it. In the meantime, Toby wins the race.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:02:56] Yeah. And I thought it was so perfect that Kelly is at the finish line, like on her phone. Like.



JENNA FISCHER [01:03:02] Yes. And he's like, "Where are we"? And she's like, "We're about five kilometers from the office". And Toby's like, "Why didn't Michael make it a circle"?



ANGELA KINSEY [01:03:13] No, he couldn't have made it easy.



JENNA FISCHER [01:03:15] He made it a straight line. Well, it's interesting. So that spot where they are is pretty much right outside of our real office actually. That was on Saticoy Street where we shot. So we actually were very, very close. Like we, we just walked back to set at the end.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:03:35] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [01:03:35] So we actually did end very close to our office.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:03:39] You know, I guess, it's interesting because Pam, like, I think she's going to give Michael a pep talk, but she's like, "No, you don't got this". You're like, it's more like Pam sass of like, there's other people that are better at helping people, why don't you just let this one go? And then Michael's like, "You don't know me, you've just seen my penis". And somehow Pam not cheering him on makes him cheer himself on. And he has this talking head where he's like finishing that 5K was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. I ate more fettuccini Alfredo and drink less water than he ever has in his entire life. This was so funny to me. He slowly makes his way across the finish line and I caught a palm tree.



JENNA FISCHER [01:04:29] Yeah, yeah.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:04:30] Did you see it?



JENNA FISCHER [01:04:32] Yes, I did.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:04:32] Yeah. 39 minutes, 46 seconds, Palm Tree Alert.



JENNA FISCHER [01:04:38] We did not, I guess we didn't paint that one out.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:04:40] Yeah, I'm sure there are others along the way because, you know, we're filming outside so much. But he finally makes it across the finish line and Jim gives him the lamp as a trophy. And he pukes.



JENNA FISCHER [01:04:53] Yeah. Probably some kind of mushroom soup.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:04:57] Oh, it looked, it looked gross, it looked rea-.



JENNA FISCHER [01:04:59] It was so gross.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:05:00] It looked so gross. And he let it just dribble down his chin. I'm like, wipe that off your face.



JENNA FISCHER [01:05:06] So gross. Well, this episode ends with Michael in the hospital, and Meredith has wheeled herself in to his room to visit him.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:05:17] Yes, there is a deleted scene that Michael checked himself into the hospital for dehydration and he requested his childhood pediatrician come visit him.



JENNA FISCHER [01:05:28] Oh.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:05:29] And his pediatrician is a very elderly man. And he's saying, you know, Michael doesn't really need to be in the hospital. He got a little dehydrated. Really this all could have been solved with a bottle of water. But, and then as he's talking, Michael is like, "Where's my lollipop"? He like gives him-.



JENNA FISCHER [01:05:46] Oh, my gosh.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:05:47] Yes.



JENNA FISCHER [01:05:47] So is that why he has a lollipop in this scene with Meredith?



ANGELA KINSEY [01:05:50] Yes, because his pediatrician stopped by and checked in on him and gave him a lollipop.



JENNA FISCHER [01:05:57] Well, the lollipop leads us to a very cringey final moment.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:06:01] Yes.



JENNA FISCHER [01:06:01] Which is that Michael is sucking on the lollipop, and he suggests that they share it. So he hands it to Meredith, who then sort of puts it in her mouth and then she offers it back to Michael and he says-.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:06:20] Nah.



JENNA FISCHER [01:06:20] "No, I'm good".



ANGELA KINSEY [01:06:22] I'm good.



JENNA FISCHER [01:06:22] I'm good. Well, we had some mail from Eliza Jarvis and Natalie Benari, "Please tell me the lollipop Michael shares with Meredith is switched out before they share it. Did they really share it"? Guys, I wondered the same thing when I watched this scene, there is no cut. It's, it's a oner shot of Steve taking the lollipop out of his mouth and handing it to Kate. So we asked Kate about it.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:06:56] We had to ask her about it.



JENNA FISCHER [01:06:59] And she said they did not rinse it off.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:07:03] She also said Steve improvised that in the moment and she just went with it.



JENNA FISCHER [01:07:09] Yeah, and I think, I think that's why you see her pause a second, I think you are watching Kate, the person, decide if she's going to do this.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:07:21] Yeah.



JENNA FISCHER [01:07:21] She's like, "Am I going to do this"? But brilliant ending. Good for you, Kate. Way to, way to really go for it on the show. She said she got a thrill out of doing her own sort of stunts, so.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:07:36] Yeah, well, she's brave. And, you know, there was a Dwight deleted talking head that I think would have come after this where it's really, it kind of broke my heart, where he talks about forgiveness and what it is to forgive someone and that he hopes that his friend will forgive him, because if Meredith can forgive Michael for hitting her with a car, maybe his friend will be able to forgive him and he's hopeful.



JENNA FISCHER [01:08:07] Mmm.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:08:07] I know.



JENNA FISCHER [01:08:09] Mmm.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:08:09] It made me sad.



JENNA FISCHER [01:08:11] Yeah. Well, I think that finishes out "Fun Run". We did a Fun Run.



ANGELA KINSEY [01:08:18] Thank you guys so much for joining us for the Michael Scott DMSMPMC Rabies Awareness Pro-Am Fun Run Race.
