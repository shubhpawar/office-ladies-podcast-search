OFFICE LADIES | EPISODE 91 - STRESS RELIEF, PART 2

[00:00:04] Jenna I'm Jenna Fischer.



[00:00:05] Angela And I'm Angela Kinsey.



[00:00:06] Jenna We were on The Office together.



[00:00:07] Angela And we're best friends.



[00:00:08] Jenna And now we're doing the ultimate Office rewatch podcast just for you.



[00:00:12] Angela Each week we will break down an episode of The Office and give exclusive behind the scenes stories that only two people who were there can tell you.



[00:00:19] Jenna We're the Office Ladies. Welcome, welcome. It's Stress Relief, part two.



[00:00:27] Angela Part deux.



[00:00:29] Jenna Oh.



[00:00:29] Angela Is that.



[00:00:30] Jenna We're going to be here to refined today.



[00:00:32] Angela Part dos.



[00:00:34] Jenna Oh.



[00:00:36] Angela Third language. Indonesian. Part Duot.



[00:00:38] Jenna We are a classy show. This is Season five, Episode 15, written by Paul Lieberstein, directed by Jeffrey Blitz. Let me give you a summary. Last week, if you remember, Dwight took matters into his own hands when his coworkers failed to pay attention to his fire safety seminar. He did a big fire drill.



[00:01:01] Angela He like trapped us in a burning building.



[00:01:03] Jenna He did. Stanley had a heart attack. Dwight was in hot water with corporate. We have that.



[00:01:10] Angela Right.



[00:01:10] Jenna This week, Michael learned that he was the source of Stanley's stress, not Dwight, not the fire drill. And so he thinks the best thing to do is to throw a roast.



[00:01:22] Angela Like an old school roast right.



[00:01:25] Jenna For himself.



[00:01:25] Angela Right?



[00:01:26] Jenna Yes.



[00:01:26] Angela Yeah.



[00:01:27] Jenna Where we all roast him and tell jokes at his expense.



[00:01:30] Angela And we're laughing and drinking like Dean Martin.



[00:01:32] Jenna Yeah. This is the Friars Club. This is going to be his comic relief moment. Meanwhile, Jim is still embroiled in these marital issues that Pam's parents are having. Pam's dad has been staying with Jim and Pam and Pam at the end of the last episode said, Jim, will you talk to my dad?



[00:01:52] Angela Ugh, Pam.



[00:01:52] Jenna Find out what's going on.



[00:01:53] Angela That's the worst. Like, Pam, will you go talk to my parents?



[00:01:58] Jenna Yeah.



[00:01:59] Angela I can't do it. You go do it.



[00:02:02] Jenna I cannot imagine asking Lee to go talk to my parents about their marriage.



[00:02:07] Angela Oh my lord.



[00:02:09] Jenna Could you imagine?



[00:02:10] Angela No.



[00:02:10] Jenna It would be so weird.



[00:02:11] Angela I know.



[00:02:12] Jenna Incidentally, my dad's name is Jim.



[00:02:14] Angela Does the world know that? Because someone out there right now being like, what?



[00:02:19] Jenna And my brother in law's name is Dwight.



[00:02:21] Angela Yes. Do you guys know this?



[00:02:23] Jenna And my niece's name is Cece.



[00:02:24] Angela And her best friend is named Angela.



[00:02:27] Jenna What's going on? I think we mentioned this fact in an earlier podcast, but it is interesting.



[00:02:35] Angela All right.



[00:02:37] Jenna Also last week, I want to remind everyone that this episode played after the Super Bowl. It was a super big deal.



[00:02:44] Angela And the network wanted big name stars, and our show was like, hey, no, we don't do that, not at this moment. And so we had this whole little movie playing out. So that's going on, too.



[00:02:55] Jenna Yeah. Jim and Pam and Andy are watching this pirated movie that stars Jack Black, Jessica Alba and Cloris Leachman.



[00:03:03] Angela Lot happening.



[00:03:04] Jenna I think we caught you up.



[00:03:05] Angela Yeah, you're caught up.



[00:03:06] Jenna Fast fact number one, Jeff Blitz won an Emmy for directing this episode.



[00:03:12] Angela Yeah.



[00:03:12] Jenna And he deserves it.



[00:03:13] Angela He does.



[00:03:14] Jenna This was complicated.



[00:03:16] Angela So Jeff Blitz has been on our show before. We love him.



[00:03:19] Jenna I mean, I literally love Jeff Blitz.



[00:03:20] Angela I know.



[00:03:21] Jenna I love him as a human being. I love him as a director. I would also like you to know that our editors, Dean Holland and Dave Rogers, were also nominated for an Emmy for this episode.



[00:03:34] Angela They deserve it.



[00:03:36] Jenna Dean edited the first half of the episode with the whole fire drill and Dave edited the second with the roast, which is what we will be talking about today. Fast fact number two, we had a fan question about the roast.



[00:03:49] Angela OK.



[00:03:50] Jenna Jessica K and Claire R asked, who wrote the jokes for Michael's roast? Did the cast help? Was it the writers? Was any of it improvised? Short answer is the roast was totally scripted.



[00:04:04] Angela Yeah.



[00:04:05] Jenna We as actors did not participate in writing these jokes known about one another.



[00:04:10] Angela No, no. These were all written.



[00:04:10] Jenna All written. And I found out who pitched this part of the story, the idea of the roast.



[00:04:17] Angela Who?



[00:04:17] Jenna It is none other than the man behind Princess Unicorn, Halstead Sullivan.



[00:04:23] Angela Oh, really, huh?



[00:04:26] Jenna Halsted told me that they had the CPR storyline for the first half of the episode and they needed something for the second half. So he told the writer's room that when he was growing up in Atlanta, his father was president of a medical school. And every year the medical students would put on a show and it was like kind of like a Follies show and they would do skits where they imitated their professors. He said the audience loved it. The professors, not so much.



[00:04:59] Angela Well, you know, I think Michael thinks everyone doesn't like me because I'm this jerk. They think I'm a jerk boss. Right?



[00:05:05] Jenna Yeah.



[00:05:05] Angela So here's your chance guys, have at it, you know, roast me, say whatever you want. I love that he's like, make fun of, you know, how great I look in shoulder pads or...



[00:05:15] Jenna Also traditionally roasting kind of started with the Friars Club, I believe. And it was a great honor to be the person being roasted.



[00:05:24] Angela Oh, yeah.



[00:05:24] Jenna It meant something. It was a position of status. And so I think that's another thing that is playing off Michael right now, which is that he's going to be an honoree.



[00:05:35] Angela Yeah, this is a big deal. You guys are so lucky you get to roast me.



[00:05:40] Jenna Speaking of roasts, you know, Comedy Central has kind of taken over where the Friars Club left off and they do these roasts of people every year. The Bruce Willis roast is real good, but in particular, Ed Norton roasts Bruce Willis. I was like rolling. Tears streaming down my face. It is such a good roast. When we were prepping this episode, it came to my mind. I went back and I watched it twice. I wish I could play it. It's way too long. It's so good.



[00:06:12] Angela Oh, I want to see it. I want to see it.



[00:06:14] Jenna Check it out.



[00:06:15] Angela The first time I saw Amy Schumer was on a Comedy Central roast and she was so funny. And there were a few dudes that were like kind of throwing her shade and she just decimated them.



[00:06:24] Jenna Wow. All right. Moving along. Fast fact number three, Cloris Leachman.



[00:06:29] Angela Cloris frickin Leachman.



[00:06:31] Jenna We told you there's this mini movie and Cloris Leachman is one of the stars. She kills it in this mini movie.



[00:06:39] Angela Legend. Legend.



[00:06:40] Jenna I mean, incredible. I needed to do a little breakdown of Cloris Leachman. Here it is. Cloris Leachman was born in Des Moines, Iowa. Midwesterner.



[00:06:50] Angela Did not know that.



[00:06:51] Jenna As a child, she performed at the Des Moines Little Theater. Then she won a special scholarship to study broadcast drama at Northwestern. She stayed there for a while, but then she returned to Des Moines to finish high school. Then she returned to Northwestern with a theater scholarship this time, but she dropped out again to enter a beauty contest. This beauty contest.



[00:07:19] Angela Mm hmm.



[00:07:20] Jenna She eventually made her way to the nineteen forty six Miss America pageant.



[00:07:25] Angela What?



[00:07:25] Jenna She was in the Miss America pageant.



[00:07:27] Angela For Iowa?



[00:07:28] Jenna I guess, for Iowa.



[00:07:29] Angela Wow.



[00:07:30] Jenna I'm not sure. Eventually she moved to New York. She studied at the Actor's Studio. That's a big deal acting school, guys. Then she made her Broadway debut in nineteen forty eight in a production called Sundown Beach. She became a household name when she was cast as Phyllis Lindstr√∂m on the Mary Tyler Moore Show, and then she had her own spinoff show, Phyllis. She won a best supporting Oscar for Peter Bogdanovich's The Last Picture Show, Angela.



[00:07:59] Angela Which was written by Larry McMurtry, who is from my hometown of Archer City, Texas. And they filmed it in Archer City. And it was written by, you know, Larry never officially claimed it, but folks in Archer City, so they'd be like, We're you so-and-so. Did you sleep with that person? What's happening?



[00:08:17] Jenna Oh, so people were like trying to figure out who everybody was.



[00:08:20] Angela Yeah. Yeah.



[00:08:21] Jenna Which person is Cybill Shepherd. Which person is Cloris Leachman?



[00:08:24] Angela Yeah, exactly. And Larry said it was inspired by, you know.



[00:08:29] Jenna Mm hmm.



[00:08:29] Angela Mm hmm.



[00:08:30] Jenna I don't know. I feel like there's some woman named Doris who knows. She's like, it was me.



[00:08:37] Angela Jenna, I actually read The Last Picture Show a few years after I had left Archer City and I was in college. I was like, you know what? This is a book about my hometown. I want to read it. It's so great. It's a great read.



[00:08:47] Jenna It's a great book and a great movie is what you're saying.



[00:08:50] Angela Yeah. So I'm saying don't skip the book on this one, guys.



[00:08:53] Jenna Over the course of her career, she won a total of eight Emmys for both drama and comedy by the way. She won a daytime Emmy. She won a Golden Globe award. And in 2008, at the age of 82, she was a contestant on season seven of Dancing with the Stars. She was the oldest contestant to ever dance on Dancing with the Stars, and she was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in two thousand and eleven. I mean, the legacy of this woman. Sadly, she passed away in twenty twenty one at the age of 94 and she was on our show.



[00:09:37] Angela I know.



[00:09:38] Jenna This legend.



[00:09:39] Angela Legend, amazing woman. Jenna did you know I got to spend a little bit of time with Cloris?



[00:09:44] Jenna Yes. Now, not during this episode.



[00:09:46] Angela Not during this episode.



[00:09:48] Jenna Cuz none of us met these guys during this episode.



[00:09:50] Angela No, we didn't film when they were there, which was a bummer. But I ended up co presenting an award at the 2012 Genesis Awards with Cloris. We were co presenters.



[00:10:01] Jenna Oh my gosh.



[00:10:02] Angela We had to hang out backstage. I met her daughter Dinah, who is lovely. They were the cutest mother daughter duo. And then Cloris and I went out on stage together. We presented this award and she truly was such a hoot. She, I think, was at the age in her life and in her career where she gave, as the kids say, zero F's. And then I would run into her and her daughter at different events and we would say hi because we had formed this little connection.



[00:10:30] Jenna Connection.



[00:10:30] Angela Yeah. But anyway, she was just so fun and so full of life. And I'm so glad I just got to just interact with her those few times.



[00:10:38] Jenna Yeah, I love that story, Ange. Why don't we take a break and we'll come back and break down this episode?



[00:10:43] Angela OK, great. We start this episode with Pam being kind of upset, she's just gotten off the phone with her mom and she's going to go find Jim and say, hey, what did you say to my dad?



[00:10:57] Jenna Yeah, her idea of having Jim talk to her dad did not go well. Apparently, her dad is now looking for an apartment and the divorce is on.



[00:11:06] Angela It's happening.



[00:11:07] Jenna Pam gets really worried. She has this talking head where she says, what could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in their marriage is Jim going to say this to her? She's spiraling.



[00:11:21] Angela I think she's spiraling.



[00:11:22] Jenna Yeah, I mean, that's a big leap.



[00:11:23] Angela That's a big jump.



[00:11:24] Jenna But she's upset.



[00:11:25] Angela And she's scared. Right.



[00:11:28] Jenna We had a fan question from Sally K. Was the divorce of Jim's parents a setup for the Michael/Helene relationship in season six? Helene is Pam's mom, everyone. No. This was crafted as a small representation of how our show had dramatic moments in addition to comedic ones. But because this aired after the Super Bowl, we wanted to stay away from existing storylines. So the writers had to create kind of like a brand new drama, but one that wouldn't go on to affect our regular characters too directly.



[00:12:05] Angela Right. We didn't want anything in this episode to actually affect the character arcs and relationships that were set in place.



[00:12:10] Jenna Yes. So that was kind of why this storyline was crafted. And I remember John and I really fighting for the drama of this, like really saying, no, we want to play this real. Pam is really upset. This isn't funny upset. Like I remember when I was shooting a three camera show, I was supposed to get mad at one of the other characters and I was supposed to call him a jerk. Supposed to say you're a jerk. And the director came over to me and he said, I'm so sorry. This is three camera. You need to do funny mad. Not actual mad. You're doing single camera mad.



[00:12:51] Angela Yeah. Funny mad, funny sad.



[00:12:53] Jenna He said maybe go up at the end. You're a jerk?



[00:12:56] Angela Yeah.



[00:12:57] Jenna And I was like oh ok.



[00:12:58] Angela Or stomp your foot.



[00:12:59] Jenna Yeah.



[00:13:00] Angela Something.



[00:13:01] Angela Drop something on your toe and then go, ow! You're a jerk. Ow.



[00:13:05] Jenna Oh see this is why you were good at the three camera, Angela. I couldn't get it. I couldn't get it. So anyway, John and I were like, we're going to do real upset and it's going to be OK because all the rest of the episode is going to have the comedy.



[00:13:22] Angela Mmhmm. You know, the first three camera I did after The Office, I played it really real and really quiet. It was a show called Hot in Cleveland. I was really excited to do it. Amazing actresses on that show. Craig Ferguson was a guest star. He was in there and the director came over to me and was like, could you talk faster, maybe louder and could you lower your voice or something? I don't know. Can we get her, like, some glasses like-



[00:13:49] Jenna Anything to make you, like-



[00:13:52] Angela A character or something.



[00:13:53] Jenna Comedic!



[00:13:53] Angela Yeah. And Craig Ferguson started cracking up when the director walked away and he was like, maybe get her a top hat, a patch, maybe a parrot for her shoulder. And Wendie Malick was also in the scene. And she came over and said to me and she called me kid, which I loved. She goes, Kid, you got to sell it to the back row. This is multicam. I said, Gotcha. Got it. got it. OK.



[00:14:17] Jenna Yeah.



[00:14:18] Angela They did get me glasses though.



[00:14:20] Jenna They did? Were they funny?



[00:14:22] Angela Funny! Betty White did tell me I was funny though. That was my take away.



[00:14:28] Jenna Do you have any more stories about legends? You've got Cloris Leachman. You've got Betty White. We met Carol Burnett once.



[00:14:34] Angela Well I didn't speak though, remember? I was too nervous.



[00:14:37] Jenna I didn't speak either. But we stood next to her.



[00:14:39] Angela I know but Kate Flannery talked to her and we just stood there and smiled.



[00:14:41] Jenna And then her and Kate got like a whole friendship going I think. We were so ughh. We just need to go up to Carol Burnett laughing next time.



[00:14:50] Angela Oh, no.



[00:14:51] Jenna I'm going to try that one again. I'm going to get that one out in the future.



[00:14:55] Angela Oh lord. You're going to bust it out?



[00:14:57] Jenna I am.



[00:14:57] Angela All right. Where are we? OK, Jim and Pam, we're playing real moments. Michael and Dwight are sharing a bottle of mini booze,



[00:15:04] Jenna very tiny bottle



[00:15:05] Angela Jenna, this is not the first time the tiny bottle of booze has been in an episode.



[00:15:09] Jenna When was the first time?



[00:15:10] Angela All right. In the deleted scenes of The Duel, Michael is building up the courage to tell Andy and they're walking out to the car together and Michael hands a mini bottle of booze out of his pocket in the elevator and goes, Drink this. And Andy's like, I don't know, I really like the- OK, fine. And he drinks it and he's like, ugh and he's like Angela's sleeping with Dwight. Like so I think they have these little mini bottle of booze and you don't start seeing them in deleted scenes till after they go to Canada. And I wonder I wonder if Michael took the mini bar stash.



[00:15:42] Jenna He 100 percent did.



[00:15:43] Angela Right?



[00:15:44] Jenna Of course.



[00:15:44] Angela That's what I wrote in my head anyway.



[00:15:46] Jenna Or from the airplane.



[00:15:48] Angela Yes!



[00:15:48] Jenna From first class.



[00:15:49] Angela Yes.



[00:15:50] Jenna In this scene, as they're sharing this mini bottle of booze, we are reminded that Dwight needs to get the signature of everyone in the office as an acknowledgment that they have accepted his apology for dismembering the CPR dummy last week.



[00:16:06] Angela I mean, how many apology notes is he going to have to have people sign?



[00:16:10] Jenna I don't know. But he has to get everyone's signature. He's having a hard time.



[00:16:14] Angela That's the only thing that's stressing him out.



[00:16:17] Jenna Well, this is when Michael gets his big idea, they should roast him.



[00:16:21] Angela Mm hmm.



[00:16:23] Jenna This is great. He's going to bust into the bullpen. He's going to announce we're doing a roast. I want you to really go at me. Don't hold back.



[00:16:32] Angela Yeah, you can comment on how fit I am or the fact that I'm a womanizer.



[00:16:36] Jenna He doesn't want to write the material for them, but he wants it to be good.



[00:16:40] Angela Everyone is pretty excited, I mean, Kevin is like a giggly he's so excited.



[00:16:48] Jenna I liked Oscar's talking head.



[00:16:50] Angela Say it.



[00:16:51] Jenna He was like, listen, I am a good person, but I am going to try to make Michael cry. We had a fan catch from Samantha S and Michelle S. Two people noticed this catch.



[00:17:02] Angela OK.



[00:17:03] Jenna If you're following along, starting with part two at one minute, 15 seconds, Kelly is standing in front of the shelves and her notebook is closed. But in the very next shot, it is open and upside down.



[00:17:17] Angela Oh, well, we missed that one.



[00:17:19] Jenna Clearly, she's not really taking an inventory of anything.



[00:17:23] Angela I have a question for you.



[00:17:24] Jenna What is it?



[00:17:25] Angela Who is planning this roast? There's no party planning committee meeting. But I want you to know, in deleted scenes, I found this gem: Michael is having a meeting with Darryl in the warehouse.



[00:17:37] Jenna Oh.



[00:17:38] Angela Yeah. So I'm like, wait, is Darryl in charge of this party because it's in the warehouse? So Michael is telling Darryl everything he needs. He says, I would like a stage, and Darryl points to a few wood pallets.



[00:17:48] Jenna OK?



[00:17:49] Angela And he's like, OK. And he goes, also, I need a big comfy chair or maybe a throne.



[00:17:55] Jenna That made me spit out my coffee.



[00:17:57] Angela Then he tells Darryl that he would like all the other roasters to be up on the stage too, like, you know, the Comedy Central roast where they have the deus of other roasters up there.



[00:18:05] Jenna Yup.



[00:18:06] Angela And Darryl is like looking at these tiny wood pallets, like, OK. Then Darryl is like, who's going to be in the audience? And Michael's like, we're going to charge ten dollars a head for the audience.



[00:18:17] Jenna Oh my gosh, who's coming to this?



[00:18:18] Angela Yeah. Who's coming to this? Then Michael's like, oh, also we need alcohol. OK, you need lots of alcohol and I'm going to need something to spit in for my spit takes.



[00:18:27] Jenna Oh, he's planning out that this is going to be so funny he's going to need to spit out his drink.



[00:18:32] Angela And Darryl's like, uh you're not spitting in the warehouse. Then Dwight rushes in and he's got this eight by 10 photo of Michael and Michael's like, no, no, no, no, no, I want this photo huge. It's got to cover, like, the whole back wall. OK?



[00:18:44] Jenna Yeah.



[00:18:45] Angela And then he says, I also want a drum and cymbal so I can do the ba-dump-bumps.



[00:18:49] Jenna This is amazing because all of these things are going to appear in the warehouse.



[00:18:53] Angela Yes. So I'm thinking Darryl and Dwight planned this. They were the PPC for this event.



[00:18:59] Jenna I don't want to give too much of a spoiler, but next week we're going to find out what happened to the PPC and why there is no one in charge of party planning right now.



[00:19:09] Angela Oh, yeah. So this was like foreshadowing.



[00:19:12] Jenna A little bit. Well, I guess they set everything up and Dwight has a great idea. It's actually a great idea.



[00:19:18] Angela It's brilliant.



[00:19:18] Jenna He tells everyone as they're entering that they have to sign in for the roast. But what they're really signing is his apology acknowledgment sheet. Yes.



[00:19:29] Angela But who catches it?



[00:19:32] Jenna Phyllis.



[00:19:33] Angela So good. She's so good. She is just busting his butt through this whole episode.



[00:19:38] Jenna She will not sign. She's not going to sign. She's the holdout.



[00:19:41] Angela Yeah.



[00:19:42] Jenna Everyone takes their seats. Michael sits on his throne and now the roast is going to begin.



[00:19:48] Angela Yeah.



[00:19:49] Jenna Should we take a break?



[00:19:50] Angela I think we take a break and we come back with the roasting.



[00:19:57] Jenna OK, folks, the roast is on. Michael welcomes all these jerks.



[00:20:02] Angela Yeah, who's first up? Who can't wait to get up there and roast Michael Scott? He can barely finish his sentence and she's grabbing the microphone.



[00:20:11] Jenna It's Angela Martin.



[00:20:13] Angela That's right. Jenna, I noticed something in re watching this multiple times like we do each week. Is Angela Martin ripping off Jeff Foxworthy bits?



[00:20:23] Jenna Yes. You know Angela Martin is a Jeff Foxworthy fan.



[00:20:26] Angela She's I mean, listen, listen to Jeff and then listen to Angela.



[00:20:30] Jeff Foxworthy If you've ever cut your grass and found a car. You might be a redneck.



[00:20:39] Angela And now, Angela.



[00:20:41] Angela Martin If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott. If you ever called the fire department because your head was stuck in your chair, you might be-.



[00:20:50] Crowd Michael Scott.



[00:20:51] Jenna Yes!



[00:20:51] Angela She clearly is doing Jeff's bit.



[00:20:56] Jenna Yes. One hundred percent.



[00:20:58] Angela When I re watched that, I was like, oh, my gosh, that had to be the writer's inspiration for Angela's comedic style.



[00:21:04] Jenna I was very impressed with how prepared Angela was.



[00:21:08] Angela Prepared and her mic work, like she took the mic off, waved it to the crowd for everyone to say, Michael Scott, she was into it.



[00:21:16] Jenna Next up is Kelly, and she does a list of who and what she would rather kiss than Michael Scott.



[00:21:22] Angela All right. I got to jump in and just tell you guys, there is so much extra stuff in the deleted scenes for the roast. We also find out Kelly has a second bit where she says she knows that Michael dyes his hair.



[00:21:34] Jenna Oh.



[00:21:34] Angela Yeah. That one day it was raining and his hair dyed dripped onto her arm and she color matched it. And Michael uses Clairol Natural Instincts, midnight black. She does this whole other bit. And then I think Meredith's is the most depressing. She says, Michael, you're the reason I drink. You're the reason I live to forget.



[00:21:56] Jenna Yeah.



[00:21:57] Angela Oof.



[00:21:58] Jenna Oscar roasts Michael in Spanish and he speaks very quickly. He has a lot to say.



[00:22:04] Angela A lot to say. Very passionate. There is so much more Oscar in the deleted scenes. First of all, he does multiple jokes in English before he gets to his Spanish roast. And I think we need to hear him.



[00:22:16] Oscar The only man in the state of Pennsylvania who is less likely to get legally married than me is Michael Scott. Michael Scott is so dumb he thinks balancing a checkbook is putting a checkbook on his nose and shouting, Look at me, look at me! Michael is so bad with money, he invested in Enron last week.



[00:22:39] Michael Scott That was- that was privileged.



[00:22:41] Oscar Michael is the biggest idiot I know. And finally, sometimes I lay awake at night- I'm sure all of you do, too, and wonder, what the hell did I do to deserve a boss like this?



[00:22:56] Angela I mean.



[00:22:57] Jenna Oh, my gosh.



[00:22:58] Angela He just calls him an idiot.



[00:23:00] Jenna Oh, my gosh. Michael is kind of realizing that maybe this wasn't as fun as he thought it would be. But things are in motion now. And everyone can't wait to get up on stage. Toby tries to have a turn, but Michael shoots him down.



[00:23:16] Angela Yeah, he says only friends, friends only. And then there is a deleted scene, Jenna, where Oscar brings a cell phone up on stage because Jan, who isn't there, has decided to call in so she can roast Michael.



[00:23:29] Jenna Amazing.



[00:23:30] Angela All right. We got to hear it.



[00:23:32] Jan Well, Michael, you ruined my life, OK? Everything you touch turns to crap. You have no sense of how to please any woman. I can't believe that once you wrote a phone message on my diploma and you used my daughter's christening gown as a bib, when you ate ribs. I mean, you're just you're you're just completely an ass, Michael. You're an ass!



[00:23:51] Jenna OK, I have to say, clearly, the writers had a lot of fun writing this roast because in addition to all these deleted scenes, remember last week when I said our candy bag for this episode was two hundred and seven pages?



[00:24:07] Angela Our alt jokes? Were they all roasting jokes?



[00:24:10] Jenna They are almost all alternate roast jokes. Pages and pages and pages.



[00:24:17] Angela Oh, my gosh. I do remember Jenna that people got up multiple times.



[00:24:21] Jenna Oh yeah. They just kept handing us stuff to go say. In the candy bag, they had all these alts for Jan when she called in. So in addition to this deleted one, this one really-.



[00:24:33] Angela Please share.



[00:24:34] Jenna Stuck out to me. She says, it only took one night of misguided drunken passion with Michael to ruin my entire life. I would have been better off if he'd just given me syphilis.



[00:24:45] Angela Oh my gosh.



[00:24:49] Jenna Well, now Jim is going to get up and he's going to I guess list all of the sayings that Michael has butchered.



[00:24:58] Angela Spider face.



[00:25:01] Jenna Oh my gosh.



[00:25:02] Angela Dwight is feeling bad for Michael, so he hops up on stage to defend him, right? And Michael is like, idiot, you're doing it wrong, you're doing it wrong. And then Dwight snaps and is like, what? You're calling me an idiot? Like he's up there trying to defend him. He's like, you're just a small, pathetic little man. You have no friends, no family and no land. And he walks off stage and everyone cheers.



[00:25:30] Jenna Well, now it's Pam's turn. I remember so clearly shooting this. I remember because after roasting him about falling for Internet scams and being lazy at work, I had to say that Michael's penis is small.



[00:25:46] Angela I mean, this is the ultimate nail in the coffin of the roast for Michael in particular. I mean, Michael, who's like, thinks he's like the womanizer



[00:25:56] Jenna I know, because remember, in an earlier episode, Pam knocked on the door and Michael said, come in. And he did not have his clothes on. And Pam was like, why did you say come in?



[00:26:05] Angela He was changing for Fun Run.



[00:26:06] Jenna Exactly. So Pam is going to call that back and she's going to make a joke at his expense. We did this a few ways but we started by having me just say it on the stage. But then they thought this is kind of a low blow, right?



[00:26:22] Angela Yeah. And it's bold for Pam.



[00:26:24] Jenna It is. So they were like, let's try this one on the move.



[00:26:28] Angela Yeah. Like a throw away.



[00:26:29] Jenna Exactly. And so that's what ended up making it into the episode.



[00:26:33] Angela And then we have an old tech alert that helps you really just punch him one more time.



[00:26:38] Jenna Oh yeah. Everyone's like, how small is it? And then Pam says, if it were an iPod, it'd be a shuffle. Do some people even know that joke? Do they even get that joke?



[00:26:49] Angela I don't- Do people still have iPods? It was a big deal. We were so excited to have our iPods with all of our music on it.



[00:26:54] Jenna Just music.



[00:26:55] Angela Only music, guys.



[00:26:56] Jenna And they came in different sizes and shuffle was the smallest.



[00:26:59] Angela Yeah. And you could get a tiny one and clip it on your like armband and go running. I never did that because I don't run. But.



[00:27:05] Jenna You could have.



[00:27:06] Angela You could have. It looked cool.



[00:27:07] Jenna Yeah.



[00:27:08] Angela With your headphones that had a cord that had to go to it so you couldn't pump your arms too hard.



[00:27:13] Jenna No.



[00:27:13] Angela No.



[00:27:14] Jenna Oh. How many times did I just yank that cord out of my iPod?



[00:27:18] Angela I  know.



[00:27:19] Jenna Because I was gesturing- not exercising. I'm so sorry. Please don't get the wrong idea. I was gesturing wildly.



[00:27:25] Angela Well, now Darryl is going to come up and this one was really cringey. Darryl says, Michael, you always say we're family, right?



[00:27:32] Jenna Yeah.



[00:27:32] Angela So if you're family, you know everyone's names. What's that guy's name? And he points to a warehouse employee and Michael clearly doesn't know his name. And it's so Awkward. His name is Michael. And not only is his name Michael, but Michael gave him a car ride home and they were in traffic for like an hour together. Awkward. But really, what rounds it all out is everyone singing "what I hate about you".



[00:27:55] Jenna Yeah, Andy gets up.



[00:27:58] Angela Yeah, he's written this song. We have it. We got to hear it.



[00:28:06] Andy What I hate about you, you really suck as a boss. You're the losiest, jerkiest, you're dumber than applesauce. We're stuck listening to you all day, Stanley tried to die just to get away. Well it's true. That's what I hate about you. That's what I hate about you.



[00:28:32] Jenna That was so amazing. It was so amazing on the day.



[00:28:36] Angela We were all singing.



[00:28:38] Jenna I want you guys to know, people have asked, you know, Ed did not write those lyrics. That was written by our writers. Ed figured out how to play the song on the guitar, but that was scripted. It was so good.



[00:28:50] Angela So good. But you know what? Our writers could throw Ed anything and I felt like he just was like, done.



[00:28:57] Jenna I mean, that's a good thing to have.



[00:28:59] Angela It is.



[00:28:59] Jenna Secret weapon.



[00:29:00] Angela Secret weapon.



[00:29:02] Jenna Well, guys, Michael isn't happy.



[00:29:06] Angela It looks like he might cry.



[00:29:07] Jenna And then the next day, the phone rings and Pam says Michael's not in the office. Michael didn't come to work.



[00:29:15] Angela No.



[00:29:16] Jenna He's so depressed. Dwight says it's very unusual for Michael not to show up. He is either depressed or maybe he's been impaled by an icicle. He does have a terrible habit of standing underneath them, staring up at them. Despite Dwight's many warnings.



[00:29:32] Angela Many warnings. The gang is in the break room, you know, sort of saying, is he OK? What shall we do? And Creed has one of those lines Jenna that made John break. It's a classic creed line. Phyllis says, I hope he's OK. I feel bad. Creed says, give it up. He's dead. Jim says, he just sent a text. Creed goes, What's a text? What's a text, like sent everyone into laughing fits.



[00:29:59] Jenna That aspect of Creed's character was John's kryptonite.



[00:30:02] Angela Yes.



[00:30:03] Jenna Yeah. The you're not real.



[00:30:05] Angela You're not real. What's a text?



[00:30:07] Jenna Yeah. He loved that stuff. Well, we do eventually find Michael. He is sitting alone at a playground.



[00:30:15] Angela In a black turtleneck with a black coat. He looks the sleekest he's ever looked.



[00:30:20] Jenna Like, what is this casual outfit?



[00:30:23] Angela I know and he has like nice jeans on with like appropriate sort of black dress shoes. Kind of.



[00:30:28] Jenna He's feeding full slices of bread to invisible birds. I'll have you know, this location alert, this was North Hollywood Community Center Park where we shot this little bit of Steve and his turtleneck.



[00:30:42] Angela There's lots more in the deleted scenes, him talking to little kids, him trying to shoot baskets like yeah.



[00:30:48] Jenna Michael explains in a talking head that, you know, sometimes he has to get away. He needs to get perspective. And we learn like he is not OK.



[00:30:56] Angela Right. But him imagining a spaceman on a star very far away.



[00:31:00] Jenna That might help him.



[00:31:01] Angela It might help him.



[00:31:02] Jenna Get that perspective.



[00:31:03] Angela Yeah.



[00:31:04] Jenna Back in the office, Dwight is still trying to get Phyllis' signature on this form.



[00:31:08] Angela She's the only one. She's the only one that hasn't signed.



[00:31:11] Jenna So guess what? Delivery. There's a delivery man who has come in in a very, I would say, noticeably generic uniform.



[00:31:22] Angela There's a package for Phyllis.



[00:31:23] Jenna For Phyllis. But she has to sign for it.



[00:31:25] Angela Yeah.



[00:31:26] Jenna I loved this gag. She signs the clipboard and as soon as she signs, the clipboard, like, disappears from the man's hands.



[00:31:34] Angela It's got like one of those chains and it's being dragged away. The pen has a chain to the clipboard.



[00:31:39] Jenna And it's Dwight over in the hallway. He got his signature.



[00:31:43] Angela He did. Well, this was a fun cameo played by our very own producer, James Kerry.



[00:31:49] Jenna Yes, James Kerry who's been helping us out on the podcast.



[00:31:52] Angela Yeah.



[00:31:53] Jenna This is him. If you wondered what he looked like, there he is.



[00:31:56] Angela There he is. James was on the show the whole time.



[00:31:59] Jenna Yeah, he was with us from the very beginning.



[00:32:01] Angela The very beginning. So it was really fun to have him on stage with us filming. And we reached out to him and asked him about this moment.



[00:32:08] Jenna James said that he never asked to be an actor on the show. And one day he just got this random phone call from Ben who worked in Allison Jones's office. Ben was Allison's casting associate and he told him, we have a role in Stress Relief. There's one line. We'd like you to play it. And James was like, yes, of course I said yes. And this was just, you know, this was just a cool thing that Greg and Allison would do from time to time. They would feature longtime crew members in the show.



[00:32:43] Angela Well, we would always get really excited. And James told us that for him, the day on set was really fun. Exciting. I mean, he'd he'd worked for a long time in the entertainment industry, but he said when you're in front of the camera and other people are depending on you to hit your mark and deliver your dialogue, all of a sudden he got really nervous and he said he was expecting a little more directing because he's not an actor at all. But they didn't really give him much. They're just like, go there. Say your line. But he did say after one or two takes, Jeff Blitz suggested to him, maybe look like you're up to something, you know, give it a little something. And he's like, I think that's the take they used. But his whole family saw it because it was on after the Super Bowl.



[00:33:27] Jenna Yes, but James said when they first said, we've got a role for you, it's one line as the delivery man, he didn't realize it was for the Stress Relief episode.



[00:33:36] Angela Yeah.



[00:33:37] Jenna So when he said yes, he just wasn't putting it together that he was saying yes to the Super Bowl episode. He said his dad was particularly excited. And when he told his brother and sister at first, he said he thinks they didn't believe him. They thought he was kidding.



[00:33:51] Angela Yeah. Yeah. He said they were like, yeah, sure, you're going to be on. Yeah. Whatever.



[00:33:55] Jenna And then there he was. He was on it.



[00:33:58] Angela Well, the episode is wrapping up and so is the movie Mrs. Albert Hannaday. Andy's moved to tears. He's watching Jack Black and Cloris Leachman break up.



[00:34:07] Jenna Yeah, she's very slowly moving up the staircase in her special motorized chair.



[00:34:13] Angela And he's crying, saying hit reverse.



[00:34:16] Jenna So I shared last week that we shot this on location at a house in West Los Angeles. Randy told me the house already had this chairlift. We did not install it.



[00:34:29] Angela I would think that they scouted a house with a chairlift.



[00:34:32] Jenna He also said that because they wanted this mini film to really look like a real movie, we shot the Mrs. Hannaday sequence on film.



[00:34:43] Angela Dang!



[00:34:44] Jenna It was our first time shooting something for our show on film. We normally used the digital cameras. We even had a steady cam film camera. And since they only had one day to shoot all these scenes, Jeff Blitz and Randall Einhorn did a full blocking rehearsal with stand ins where they planned out every single shot. They created official storyboards, just like you do on a film. And Randy even sent us pictures. And they exactly matched the mini movie. There's a woman who's standing in for Cloris Leachman kind of slowly moving up the staircase, and that is how they were able to get this elaborate shoot done on film, which normally takes a lot longer than shooting on digital. They could do it in one day.



[00:35:30] Angela Yes. So, Randy sent us pictures of how they staged it and it was so fun to see them because Anna, who was in charge of locations, played Jack Black and then Jasmine, who was our second AD plays Cloris Leachman. So we'll have to put one of those pictures in our stories. It was fun to see their faces.



[00:35:47] Jenna In addition to wrapping up the movie storyline, we're going to find out what exactly Jim said to Pam's dad.



[00:35:57] Angela Yeah, Pam's dad comes to the office and they have this whole conversation in the parking lot. Now, we can't hear it. We see it, but we don't know what they're saying.



[00:36:05] Jenna We had a phone question from Stephanie P. What did Pam say to her dad in the parking lot? There was never any dialog for this in the script. This was always a silent spy shot. In fact, here's what it said. It said, Jim's POV, Pam is talking with her father. The conversation goes back and forth. Pam looks angry. The dad says something. She looks up at Jim with tears in her eyes. The dad leaves and Pam walks back inside.



[00:36:35] Angela So you guys just had to fill in the blanks there.



[00:36:38] Jenna We did. Now, Pam's dad was played by Rick Overton and he will be back again in Niagara. And Rick is actually a really funny guy. He's like an improvization comedy veteran. He's also a writer. He won an Emmy for writing an episode of Dennis Miller Live. So it's funny to me how we would cast people with great pedigree to stand and do a silent POV shot in the parking lot. But that was because this is a big role. Pam's dad. If we bring him back, we need to make sure this person has the chops to go the distance. And Rick was great and we just improvised dialogue. We just improvised what he might be saying to her that would cause her to be hurt. It was mostly a spin on like, I'm sorry, but I need to leave your mother. You know, he knew that scripted line that Pam says later and he would say that to me. And I would look up at the window and all that kind of stuff. So, yeah, but he was great. And by the way, he reached out to us because he knew we were coming up on this episode and he said, if you would not mind, would you tell people that I have a new improvised standup special called Rick Overton's Set List, and you can find it through comedy dynamics.



[00:37:54] Angela Oh, nice.



[00:37:55] Jenna And we can put a link in the show notes for anyone who wants to check it out.



[00:37:58] Angela That's great.



[00:37:59] Jenna Well, this all leads us into this Pam talking head that gets quoted back to me all the time.



[00:38:04] Angela It's a very sweet talking head.



[00:38:07] Jenna It is. Pam says when you're young, you assume your parents are soul mates. Her kids are going to be right about that.



[00:38:14] Angela Yeah. Andy overhears it, throws papers in the air because he's like- his whole running bit is that Pam and Jim are sort of relationship geniuses and that they can see all of this stuff happening in a movie that he can't see. This deep relationship like storyline that he just can't see. Because it's not there, Andy.



[00:38:34] Jenna No. He says he would never be insightful enough to be a movie critic, but he could maybe be a food or art critic.



[00:38:41] Angela Mm hmm. Here comes Michael in his black turtleneck and his black coat. I'm still, like, obsessed with this outfit. He said he spent the afternoon in the park trying to feed pigeons, but I guess they'd all flown west for the winter.



[00:38:54] Jenna Yeah.



[00:38:55] Angela And he just had some thoughts he wanted to share with everyone. Pam says, what? And he said, I wrote them down so I wouldn't forget.



[00:39:05] Jenna Oh, boy, here it comes. This is the boom roasteds.



[00:39:11] Angela It is.



[00:39:11] Jenna Boom. Roasted.So, you know, I told you that Holstead Sullivan came up with the idea for the roast storyline?



[00:39:18] Angela Yeah.



[00:39:19] Jenna I had to know who came up with, Boom Roasted.



[00:39:22] Angela Who did?



[00:39:23] Jenna All right. I got a hot tip that it might be Justin Spitzer or Gene Stupnitsky.



[00:39:28] Angela OK.



[00:39:29] Jenna I reached out to them.



[00:39:30] Angela And.



[00:39:31] Jenna Nope.



[00:39:31] Angela Nope?



[00:39:32] Jenna They thought maybe it was Charlie Grandy.



[00:39:35] Angela Oh was it?



[00:39:37] Jenna I don't have Charlie's info.



[00:39:38] Angela Oh.



[00:39:39] Jenna So I reached out to Jen Celotta.



[00:39:41] Angela Plot thickens.



[00:39:42] Jenna I said Jen, do you know if Charlie Grandy wrote Boom Roasted? These are the emails I exchanged with people now.



[00:39:49] Angela I know. Oh, I know.



[00:39:51] Jenna Jen said, I think so, but let me text him. And then- I just love Jen Celotta so much.



[00:39:57] Angela I know.



[00:39:58] Jenna She writes me back, boom roasted was Charlie! Three exclamation points. We did it. So I wrote Justin and I said, Justin, it was Charlie Grandy. And he said, Great, I would like some credit on the podcast for sending you down the right road. I said, you will get it.



[00:40:12] Angela Thank you, Justin.



[00:40:13] Jenna Thank you, all of you guys.



[00:40:14] Angela I know. I know.



[00:40:15] Jenna I had to know. Boom roasted is so famous.



[00:40:18] Angela Who did boom roasted?



[00:40:18] Jenna Charlie Grandy.



[00:40:19] Angela Charlie Grandy. Well, I think we need to hear these. I'm going to read them to you. Michael says, Jim, you're six 11 and you weigh 90 pounds. Gumby has a better body than you. Boom. Roasted. Dwight. You're a kiss ass.



[00:40:35] Both Boom. Roasted.



[00:40:37] Angela Pam. You failed art school.



[00:40:39] Both Boom. Roasted.



[00:40:40] Angela Meredith. You've slept with so many guys, you've started to look like one.



[00:40:44] Both Boom. Roasted.



[00:40:46] Angela Kevin, I can't decide between a fat joke and a dumb joke.



[00:40:49] Both Boom. Roasted.



[00:40:51] Angela Creed, your teeth called. Your breath stinks.



[00:40:53] Both Boom. Roasted.



[00:40:55] Angela Angela. Where's Angela? Oh, there you are. I didn't see you there behind that grain of rice.



[00:41:00] Both Boom. Roasted.



[00:41:02] Angela Stanley. You crush your wife during sex and your heart sucks.



[00:41:06] Both Boom. Roasted.



[00:41:07] Angela Oscar you are... Gay.



[00:41:12] Both Boom. Roasted.



[00:41:13] Angela Andy, Cornell called. They think you suck and you're gayer than Oscar.



[00:41:17] Both Boom. Roasted.



[00:41:18] Angela Well now Stanley is cackling.



[00:41:21] Jenna Hysterically laughing.



[00:41:22] Angela He can't stop laughing. I mean, it's egging Michael on. He's laughing. Everyone seems to have turned a corner.



[00:41:29] Jenna Michael is very good at roasting, I guess.



[00:41:33] Angela And Michael has a talking head that wraps up the whole moment. He says, They say that laughter is the best medicine. So, Stanley, you can throw away those pills. You are cured. Actually, you know what? You should you better hold onto those pills just in case.



[00:41:47] Jenna Well, lady, I had a lot of fun looking at the candy bag alternates for this as well.



[00:41:52] Angela Oh, what do you got?



[00:41:53] Jenna Oh, OK. So first of all, with a lot of characters, they had a lot of roastable things. Your character of Angela Martin, every roast is a spin on hiding behind a grain of rice. Every one. It was so funny to me. They clearly came up with that idea, I couldn't see you behind that grain of rice, and they were like, that's it. We're not going to do better than that. Because there were some slight alternates but it always ended with, oh, I'm sorry, I couldn't see you behind that grain of rice. Which was very funny to me. Here are a few of the alternates that stood out to me. Oh, Pam, did you not hear me through that dirty mop you call hair? Boom. Roasted.



[00:42:35] Angela Oh my god.



[00:42:37] Jenna And this one. They say people tend to be attracted to people who look like themselves. So I don't know what happened with Jim and Pam. Their kid's going to look like a pair of stilts with boobs. Have fun giving birth to that, Pam. Boom. Roasted. But this is my favorite. There's a whole page of Toby boom roasteds.



[00:42:55] Angela Oh, my gosh.



[00:42:57] Jenna But they are all just Michael telling him to f off and that he hates him. Here is an example in all caps. Toby, (BLEEP) you. I hope you die. Boom roasted. That's it.



[00:43:13] Angela Oh, well, the episode is going to end with our movie, Mrs. Albert Hannaday.



[00:43:18] Jenna And it's a real surprise ending.



[00:43:20] Angela Yeah.



[00:43:20] Jenna Big twist at the end.



[00:43:22] Angela Jack Black as Sam is returning to Lilly's house played by Cloris. He's got flowers and a walking cane in his hand. He's running up to the front door.



[00:43:34] Jenna As he gets there, he looks through the window. She's with another man. Another young man.



[00:43:39] Angela Yeah. And they are in the throes of passion.



[00:43:42] Jenna It's very, very, very much of a love scene.



[00:43:47] Angela It's a make out.



[00:43:48] Jenna It's a big make out.



[00:43:48] Angela It's a real big make out.



[00:43:50] Jenna The man she is making out with is a writer's assistant, Nate Fetterman.



[00:43:56] Angela Nate, we had to know, how did you get this job?



[00:44:01] Jenna He sent in this audio clip. And I promise you, you will hang on his every word.



[00:44:08] Nate Fetterman Hi, my name is Nate Fetterman. I was one of the writer's assistants on Stress Relief and I got to make out with Cloris Leachman and this is my story. Originally, my part was supposed to be for Zac Efron and there were actual lines, but he turned it down and so did Corbin Blue and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. And the day before it was supposed to shoot, they hadn't cast it and all the lines had been cut. And they really just needed somebody who was young looking to make out with Cloris Leachman. They didn't have to be handsome or famous. So enter me. Paul Lieberstein and Jeff Blitz, who is directing the episode, pulled me aside at work and asked me if I was interested in doing the part. And I'm not an actor. The last time I performed was in fifth grade. I was Muddle, the Tailor in Fiddler on the Roof, and I froze in the middle of Wonder of Wonder, Miracle of Miracles, and the audience laughed at me and it was scarring. But I was really excited to earn five hundred bucks and residuals. So I said, Sure, I'll do it. At the time I was so terrified of letting the show down. It was working with all these incredible actors and actresses who actually knew what they were doing and I just didn't want to screw things up for everybody. So I went home that night and I told my girlfriend, now my wife, about what I was going to have to do. And I was really scared. So I practiced with her and I didn't get much sleep that night. And then I woke up early the next day and I arrived on location and I was just terrified because I was so out of my element. And I'm in hair and makeup and they're doing my hair. And all of a sudden I feel these hands running through my hair and I hear this voice go, "I hear that you and I are going to be doing some kissing later". And I turn around and it's Cloris Leachman and she's smiling at me. And I'm like, yeah, we're going to be doing the scene together. So then we go to the actual set and I'm riding in a van with Cloris Leachman and Jack Black and Jessica Alba. And these are big name stars and I'm the writer's assistant on The Office and so out of my element and I'm just desperate not to seem like a total hack and screw things up for everyone. So eventually it's time for the kissing scene with Cloris. And we're positioned on the couch and she's sitting on my lap and I have my arms around her and we're talking and it's very pleasant and she's very nice and she's telling me about her children. But then right before we do the actual take, she gets real serious. You know, she's getting into character and she looks me in the eye and I'll never forget this. She goes, when they call action, I want you to grab my ass and really get up in the crack. So when they called action, I grabbed her ass and I really got up in that crack. And we did the scene. We shot it many times. They had to get it from a lot of different angles. So we ended up making out quite a bit. She did say a variety of other pretty raunchy things. She's an expert at dirty talk, but it was an amazing experience. And I'm incredibly grateful that my five seconds of fame were spent with an absolute legend like Cloris Leachman. And it's something that I always get a kick out of when I get to tell people.



[00:47:42] Jenna Nate, thank you. Thank you for sharing your story.



[00:47:46] Angela I mean, what an amazing story.



[00:47:48] Jenna Amazing. Hey, Nate. Zac Efron isn't available. What are you doing tomorrow? Can you do something for me real quick? Sure. What is it? It's just that scene where you make out with Cloris Leachman. Oh okay sure. I guess so.



[00:48:05] Angela And you get five hundred bucks.



[00:48:06] Jenna Yeah. And a great story.



[00:48:08] Angela And a story for your lifetime.



[00:48:11] Jenna Yes. You know what? In these kind of over-the-top moments, you have to go for it. And Cloris was saying, sweetie, I give you permission to go for it. You grab my butt.



[00:48:21] Angela You sell it, sell it.



[00:48:23] Jenna That's what the scene needs. And we can't be shy with each other. We have to go for it. And I've been in situations with actors where we've given one another permission and it's so helpful because it gets you out of your head and you're like, OK, good.



[00:48:37] Angela Now we can play the scene.



[00:48:39] Jenna Have fun with it.



[00:48:40] Angela Have fun with it. I mean, you guys watch every single Dwight Angela make out.



[00:48:44] Jenna Exactly.



[00:48:44] Angela Sometimes you just got to go for it. And on our set, I think we were so good about being like, OK, I'm cool with this. You do this, we're fine. We communicated.



[00:48:53] Jenna And I have to imagine you're with this legend performer, Cloris Leachman.



[00:48:59] Angela I'd be timid.



[00:49:00] Jenna Yes. You've never met this person. So for her to just be so fun and up for it like that. And to just say, do it, baby, do it, I love it.



[00:49:11] Angela Yeah.



[00:49:12] Jenna Well, there you have it. Stress Relief, Part Two. Do you feel less stressed? Have you had some relief of your stress after listening to this podcast, everyone? I hope.



[00:49:21] Angela I hope so. I hope our podcast doesn't stress people out. If we can leave anything with you from Stress Relief other than boom roasted it's ah, ah, ah, ah-



[00:49:32] Jenna I was going to say that.



[00:49:33] Both Stayin Alive. Stayin alive. Ah, ah, ah, ah stayin alive.



[00:49:40] Jenna Oh, my God, that was- now people are stressed. We relieved their stress, and then we gave it right back. I'm so sorry. Start over, start the podcast again.



[00:49:50] Angela Bye you guys. Have a great week. We'll see you next week.
