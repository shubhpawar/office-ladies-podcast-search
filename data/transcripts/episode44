OFFICE LADIES | EPISODE 44 - PHYLLISâ€™ WEDDING

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:04] I'm Jenna Fischer.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:05] I'm Angela Kinsey.

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:06] We were on "The Office" together.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:07] And we're best friends.

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:08] And now we're doing the ultimate office rewatch podcast just for you.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:12] Each week we will break down an episode of "The Office" and give exclusive behind-the-scenes stories that only two people who were there can tell you.

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:19] We're the "Office Ladies". Hey, lady.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:25] Hey, lady, how are you?

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:27] I'm good. I'm taking an Instagram video.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:30] What?

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:31] They can't hear you, though, on my video. I can hear you on my headphones.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:35] I was doing all these old dance moves.

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:37] Oh, I missed that.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:38] Right before we record, Sam plays a little bit of Creed's song, our, our music. And Jenna and I kind of just bop around and we, kind of just helps us get into the episode.

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:48] Every week we dance to Creed's song.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:50] Love it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:51] Well what are we talking about this week, Angela?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:54] Oh Jenna. I am so excited because we are talking about "Phyllis' Wedding".

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:59] I love it so much.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:01] It's so good.

JENNA FISCHER [00:01:01] This is Season 2, Episode 15, written by Caroline Williams and directed by Ken Whittingham. Summary.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:08] Do It.

JENNA FISCHER [00:01:08] Phyllis and Bob Vance, of Vance Refrigeration, are getting married. Today is the day. Phyllis has asked Michael to push her father's wheelchair down the aisle. But after getting upstaged when Phyllis' dad decides to walk down the aisle, Michael tries to steal the show and is eventually bounced from the reception by Dwight. In the meantime, Pam is sad and upset by Jim and Karen's relationship and the fact that Phyllis stole all of her wedding ideas and she leaves the reception with Roy.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:43] I forgot that Pam left with Roy. I forgot.

JENNA FISCHER [00:01:47] Me too. And I'm Pam.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:49] It's so good, though. It's so good.

JENNA FISCHER [00:01:52] But doesn't that happen? Like if you've been with someone a really long time and then you break up, you get back together a couple times before you really break up, right? That's real.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:02:02] Especially you're at a wedding and there's all these couples and the person you want to be with doesn't seem like they want to be with you. All of a sudden, the thing that you know is sitting right next to you, so you're like, well, OK, I feel like having some lovin'.

JENNA FISCHER [00:02:19] Yeah, I guess so. All right, well, listen Fast Fact Number One, a lot of people wrote in. Sovereign Hurley, Ellie Trevelyan, Winter Pulver, Leah Barbaro, Tia Menoski and many more want to know, where was the wedding filmed? But then Colby Lindemann, Dana Hill, Christina, Caroline and Jennifer all wanted to know, "Is it the same church where Jim and Pam had their wedding? Because they look very similar". It is not the same church.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:02:51] It's not the same church.

JENNA FISCHER [00:02:53] But listen, before I tell you where Phyllis' wedding was filmed, we got even more mail about it. OK? Charis wrote in to say, "At some point, Phyllis and Pam both say they are Presbyterians. Was the wedding filmed at an actual Presbyterian church? I'm guessing the answer is yes, because the crew pays a lot of attention to detail and Presbyterian churches love maroon carpet". Chris Fur said, "I am a pastor in the Christian church, Disciples of Christ, a small Protestant denomination, less than a million people, mostly in the U.S. and Canada. In this episode, the Disciples logo is clearly visible around the 20 minute, 32 second mark as Phyllis and Bob are cutting their wedding cake. I was curious about the choice to leave that specific banner in the background, from a prop point of view, it's lighted and it's pretty distinctive". So he goes on to say, "The funny thing about it is that theologically this would be a perfect compromise choice for a Lutheran and a Unitarian who like to keep things, quote unquote, 'spicy'. Any background on this would be cool as it is a big hit with our little disciple's family". Yes, we filmed Phyllis' wedding at the first Christian Church of North Hollywood, which is located in Studio City. And they are Disciples of Christ Church.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:18] Yes. So when I first moved to L.A., I was looking for somewhere to go for Easter services. And I was driving around and I drove past this church. And it's such a beautiful church. You know, it's the red brick and it has a steep-, it looks very much like that is what a church looks like. You know what I mean?

JENNA FISCHER [00:04:34] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:36] And I drove past it and they had a big sign about their Easter service. And I thought, oh, well, I'll go there for Easter services and I did and it was very nice.

JENNA FISCHER [00:04:45] Well, I'll give you another little fun fact about this church, Ang.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:47]  What?

JENNA FISCHER [00:04:48] This is where Kent Zbornak and his wife, Shelly, got married.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:53] Oh, come on.

JENNA FISCHER [00:04:54] And guess what? They just celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary this past May.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:00] Oh, that's so great. That's so lovely.

JENNA FISCHER [00:05:02] Congratulations, you guys. And then, guys, the reception took place in their social hall, which was on the second floor. So we were able to film everything at this one church.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:15] Yes. They have a fellowship hall. And they had you know, they had the rooms like where Phyllis gets ready.

JENNA FISCHER [00:05:20] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:20] You know, all of that was already at this church.

JENNA FISCHER [00:05:24] Well, incidentally, years later, we filmed a school recital scene for my TV show, "Splitting Up Together", in that sort of hall and our holding room for hair and makeup was that same room where Phyllis is getting ready before her wedding. And there's that famous scene with Michael. And I was like texting everybody, I was like blowing up everyone's texts. I'm like, "I'm in the room where the fart happened".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:50] Here's another little thing about that church I filmed there one day by myself because it's where Phillip went to daycare.

JENNA FISCHER [00:05:56] Oh, well, are you ready for Fast Fact Number Two?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:00] I am.

JENNA FISCHER [00:06:00] We reached out to Phyllis. It's "Phyllis' Wedding".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:04] I know. How could we not talk to Phyllis, you guys? We are so thrilled.

JENNA FISCHER [00:06:09] So Phyllis is back in St. Louis. She moved back there semi-permanently a couple of years ago and she sent in some audio clips. So the first thing we asked Phyllis was just what was it like to get this script and wear a wedding gown?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:24] Here's the fun thing. Jenna, Phyllis and I are the three cast members that had big weddings, and it's kinda like it is your wedding. Because it's all about you. It's kind of really fun.

JENNA FISCHER [00:06:36] Yes. All right. So, Sam, play her clip.

PHYLLIS SMITH [00:06:40] Hi, ladies. It's Phyllis Smith, or soon to be known as Phyllis Lapin Vance of Vance Refrigeration. At least after this episode. Right? I was so thrilled when I saw this script. And let's be truthful. Every time we had a table read, we'd all get to the table, look at this script and see how many lines we had. So I was really excited and taken back when I saw that I was getting married to my love of my life. The whole episode, I really enjoyed it all. You ask about my dresses. Well, back in those days, sounds like the Dark Ages, but it was early 2000. Plus size women didn't have a lot of choices. We either looked like the grandmother or their great grandmother of the bride. There were not a lot of choices to be made for heavyset brides. And so I was just glad that I had a dress that looked pretty and, and was pretty comfortable. I have to give a shout out to wardrobe. They really, really took care of me. Every time I had to go to the restroom or anything, you know, they were right there to help me out with everything. But yeah. Back in those days, I didn't have a lot of choices. And so I just wanted to make sure that my arms were covered. I have a thing about my arms showing on camera and in public. As far as the dress was concerned, yeah, I was happy with it. It was fairly comfortable. And like I said, wardrobe really kept me, they were right there every second of the, of the moment.

JENNA FISCHER [00:08:20] I thought she looked gorgeous in this episode.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:08:22] She looked so beautiful. That is the first time I've heard Phyllis' voice in a while and Jenna, it just, it really made me tear up when I listened to it the first time, when she sent them over.

JENNA FISCHER [00:08:36] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:08:36] She just, you can just hear Phyllis' just pure, she's just a pure soul. You know what I mean?

JENNA FISCHER [00:08:42] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:08:42] And you just hear it when she talks.

JENNA FISCHER [00:08:44] Do you know what one of my favorite parts of that audio clip was, Ang? Was that she referred to herself as Phyllis Lapin Vance of Vance Refrigeration.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:08:53] I know, I know.

JENNA FISCHER [00:08:54] She added it to the end.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:08:57] I know.

JENNA FISCHER [00:08:57] I love it.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:08:58] Well, that was so fun to hear Phyllis. And she sent in several audio clips, you guys. So we're gonna hear from her throughout this episode.

JENNA FISCHER [00:09:04] Oh, and she sent in some good stuff.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:06] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:09:07] Fast Fact Number Three is Ken Whittingham, the director of this episode joined us for an interview.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:13] Ken directed several episodes of "The Office", and we just loved him. The cast loved Ken. And Sam, play his interview. Ken Whittingham, thank you so much for stopping by.

JENNA FISCHER [00:09:28] Hi, Ken.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:09:29] Hey, hey, thank you for having me.

JENNA FISCHER [00:09:31] It is so nice to see you.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:33] Just so lovely.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:09:35] I think about all the great times we had on the show. And I haven't seen you guys in so long. And it's so, so amazing to see your faces.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:42] We look just the same, right, Ken?

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:09:44] Exactly the same. Maybe a little, well, maybe a little younger.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:48] Oh, OK.

JENNA FISCHER [00:09:49] Yes. That's what I would have said as well.  Well, Ken, we always like to start by asking our guests a little bit about how they got their job on "The Office". Can you tell us how you met Greg and how you came to be a part of the show?

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:10:05] Sure. I got a call from my agent. And he said they're, they're going to redo "The Office" in America. NBC is going to do "The Office". And I was already a big fan of the British version. I said, sure, I'll go for the interview. And so they sent me, they actually sent me the DVD. And I didn't have a lot of hope for it. I said, oh, I hope they don't mess this up because it was such a brilliant show and I watch it and I was like, wow, this is really good. So I went in for the interview and I met with Teri Weinberg and Greg Daniels and we talked about it and we'd talk about if America was ready for this type of show. And, and we really talked extensively about it. You know, if America was going to get it. And I was very optimistic and saying that I think America is ready for something, you know, something different, something new. And that's how we've met. We've met, I guess it was right before we, right before the season started. Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:11:03] So they had done the pilot and then they were looking for directors for the series.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:11:08] Correct. Correct.

JENNA FISCHER [00:11:09] Wow.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:11:11] Yeah, yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:11:11] I can definitely see Greg eating up that conversation, you know, sort of like talking about the show and how it's going to hit America and how America is going to react to it. Like that's all sort of like he's so open to those kind of conversations, you know?

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:11:24] Yeah, we've talked a long time about it. That's basically all we talked about because I referenced, I remember referencing another show that really didn't work that well in America, I think was called "Absolutely Fabulous".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:11:36] Oh, yeah.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:11:37] They tried it in America. And it was funny because I was going down this, down this road that I really didn't want to go. I'd say, yeah, just like the show, "Absolutely Fabulous". It's-, oh, before you say too much. We did that show also. We produced that show. It wasn't great Greg, it was Teri Weinberg. So they said, well, what didn't you like about that show? I said, well, I said, I think everybody, which is true. I think everybody looked too pretty. Everybody was just really good looking. And it just didn't feel real, you know?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:12:07] Ken, you directed a lot of episodes on "The Office" and two were on location. You had Michael's birthday, that was at the ice skating rink. Now, Phyllis' wedding. What was it like having us travel and be on location?

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:12:19] It was great. It was great moving, being outside, because sometimes the office can get a little claustrophobic and it's, and it's very safe. You know, the challenge to moving outside or going on location is still give it that, that feel of Scranton, you know, or someplace other than Studio City. So.

JENNA FISCHER [00:12:38] Yeah.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:12:39] So, you know, so we didn't want to see palm trees. And so that was a real challenge. And so during prep, we would, we would, we really prepped heavily to make sure that it looked somewhat like Scranton or somewhere else, some place nondescript. So that was fun and it was just fun to be in new spaces and try different things and, and kind of open the show up. I'm always a big fan of any show that I do going outside and getting into the world a little bit.

JENNA FISCHER [00:13:07] I think something people don't realize is the prep process for an episode. How long would you get to prep an episode? Because we've said we shoot for a week. But how long was your prep before shooting?

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:13:18] Our prep was, I believe that show was four days. I believe.

JENNA FISCHER [00:13:23] That's it.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:13:24] That's not a lot to move a whole show.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:13:25] No.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:13:26] Holy cow.

JENNA FISCHER [00:13:28] And then don't you, like, ride around in a little van and look at locations, like a bunch of you all crammed in a van?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:13:35] I do. I have such a memory of you guys loading up and leaving set and  we're like, where did they go?

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:13:41] Yeah. It would really the first day because they would, they would do, they would lock down a couple like the locations department would lock down a couple of options that we would have and then I would go to those options, the director and producers, we would, we go to those locations and make, they might be two or three different places. And then we would make the decision then. And it was all about whether not it was shootable, you know, just backgrounds and just accessibility to the location. Could we get it? Could we load cameras in easily and load out easily? So there are a lot of things we had to, we had to be aware of or be conscious of. So, yeah, that would be basically on that, on that prep day, that would be the first thing we would do is go out and try to lock down locations because it would take a few days to get a permit to use specific locations.

JENNA FISCHER [00:14:27] Now, did you have a preference of shooting the episodes inside "The Office" bullpen or outside?

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:14:33] I didn't really have a preference. I don't really have a preference because, you know, the writing was just so good. I was just, I mean, literally I was reading "Phyllis' Wedding" yesterday, reading the script again. And it was just so, it's so, I don't know. It's just, it's written so well. I mean, it's just written so well. So it was just like wherever it was, it didn't matter because the words really kind of drove the comedy, you know? So.

JENNA FISCHER [00:15:01] Yeah.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:15:02] It was. That's what was great about it. You know, so.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:05] There were all of these great little moments in this episode. You know, you had the Pam and Roy dancing and then you had Angela and Dwight outside and then all these little vignettes like Michael's head bobbing up in the window. And what was that like to sort of figure out where those little moments would happen and how you captured them?

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:15:23] Well, what I would do is I kind of, I'm a super prepper. So I would, I would, I would, I kind of, I think for this episode, I made a shot list and, and the order in which we would go on, go in. So what I would do is I kind of hopscotch. I was set up something somewhere else and then take a camera and go shoot something else. And so I was always staying ahead a little bit to be able to capture all that stuff because that, that episode we had, I was just looking at it a few days ago. There were so many moments that weren't in the episode that we shot, you know? And so I think typically we would be six, seven, eight minutes are over. Typically, on every episode. So we would shoot more than a lot than we-, more than we really needed. But I would just stay ahead and just try to get it all in. You know, and just, and it was very, very planned. And some things, you know, on the day we would, we would do things that weren't planned. Like when Uncle Al went outside. I think initially he was supposed to be sitting on a bench and we got outside and it was nighttime. I said if he walked into the street, it was green and then he went the opposite way, against traffic. And cars came down and literally cars were honking and everything. So we used all that stuff, it was writ-, so none of that was scripted, we just kind of came up with that, you know, off the top of our heads, you know. So.

JENNA FISCHER [00:16:45] That created so much more tension.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:16:47] Yes.

JENNA FISCHER [00:16:48] Than him just sitting on a bench.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:16:50] Yes.

JENNA FISCHER [00:16:50] That was such a good idea.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:16:51] You were worried he was just gonna be wandering off somewhere in the night.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:16:55] Right. Exactly. Yeah. I think in the episode, you see the light turn.

JENNA FISCHER [00:16:59] Yeah.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:17:01] So we timed it and everything. So it was, that was a really a lot of fun and I'm glad that made it into the cut.

JENNA FISCHER [00:17:06] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:07] Well, Ken, I got so tickled just watching that moment when Angela Martin arrives and sees Dwight and they have that brief exchange, but that, that was kind of it. And then, then we had to go into the church and I remember playing with you about how do we, then like, we were like break left. Don't linger. Left. And all of that kind of stuff.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:17:26] Right.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:26] And I just remember you letting us play a little bit with that. And it was so absurd and ridiculous.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:17:32] Right.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:32] We just had so much fun.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:17:33] That was fun. That was a lot of fun because I just, I really wanted to create the awkwardness between the two of you, you know, because I knew that you were supposed to be meeting Dennis later on.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:43] Yes.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:17:44] And there, so there had to be this little you know, this tension, especially when he gave you that compliment, you know? And so I think that kind of, you know, I don't know in my mind that kind of sealed it, like you just became more attracted to him. And so it was easier for you to, to kind of blow this other guy off.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:01] Who was so perfect for her.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:18:03] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:05] That's a runner, you guys, that didn't make it in the episode. Phyllis sits Angela next to this guy named Dennis. She kind of tries to set her up at the, you know, at the reception. And Dennis is a vet, he loves cats, and Jesus. I mean. But she chooses Dwight because he told her, she looks like the queen of England.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:18:27] Exactly. I know. I was, I wish some of the stuff would have made it in. The stuff and Dennis. But I guess, you know, again and we just didn't have time.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:35] But there's so much good stuff in here, you know?

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:18:39] Yeah, yeah. And we even had, I think it was, I don't think it made it into the episode as well. We had Mike going, there was a chair that kind of, one of those chairs where people can't walk upstairs.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:48] Yes.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:18:49] So that was going up and down. We didn't use any of either. And we were just-. And that's the beauty about being on location, is that you have these spaces, that, and you get these ideas that you can just do stuff that's not scripted at all, you know? So that's, that's, that's one of the great things about being on location.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:08] Well, there are a lot of really great deleted scenes, so for people that have the DVDs, you have to go see all the other stuff that Ken shot.

JENNA FISCHER [00:19:15] People always want to know if the directors of episodes also have to shoot the flashback moments. Did you have to shoot that moment with little Michael at his mom's wedding to Jeff?

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:19:27] Yeah, that was a lot of fun. That was a lot of fun because we, we knew that it need to look a little vintage. And so we kind of moved the camera like it was an old VHS camera, you know? And, and then we, of course, in post, we kind of doctored it. But it was really fun. It was it was a lot of fun. And we, we shot it and we just hope that it would look great. And look, look vintage. You know, look older. So I think, I think we achieved it.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:56] It looked fantastic.

JENNA FISCHER [00:19:57] Do you do that on the first day so that then Michael can watch it later? Or do you like CGI it onto the TV?

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:20:04] Yes, we did. We shot it on the first day and then we played it back. I believe that's how we did it.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:08] Well, there were so many just fantastic big setups for this episode. Was there any moment that was the most challenging to shoot or like something really funny for you? Just, just one of these scenes that, that just hit you?

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:20:22] I don't, I don't think that there was really anything too challenging. One, one, there was one scene that was really hard to get through. I would say that was kind of challenging because we were, we cannot stop laughing. And that's when, when Michael went in to check on Phyllis to see how she was doing. And then he said, you know, did you pass gas or break wind.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:42] Break wind.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:20:46] Yeah, yeah. And, you know, the funny thing about that is that was a joke that was put into the script that wasn't really supposed to stay in the script. That-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:20:57] Really?

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:20:58] Yeah. That was never really supposed to, it was just like a joke that, wouldn't it be funny if this happened? And then it just lived. And then, Caroline was telling me this. Caroline Williams, the writer of the episode. So it just kind of stayed and we just shot it. And Michael, you know, Steve was so good. He could not stop laughing and I mean, he could not stop laughing. I've never seen him break like that. And we all were just laughing. It took us about an hour to get through it, 'cause we could not stop laughing.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:32] Well, you know, Phyllis always was able to have such this earnest expression, you know, and whenever you had to be mean to her, or just like have some random line towards her and she would look at you with these sweet eyes. So I can, I can see Steve not being able to get through it. Being like, that is really pungent. She's just like, hmmm?

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:21:54] Right. And then he started messing around with her hair and everything.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:58] Oh, my gosh.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:21:58] I was like, OK, you got to-. OK, you've got to go.

JENNA FISCHER [00:22:02] I feel like her whole interior monologue was just, six weeks vacation. Six weeks vacation. Because that's what she was going to get.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:22:11] Right, exactly.

JENNA FISCHER [00:22:13] That's how she's going to get through it.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:22:14] With Bob Vance. Yeah, exactly.

JENNA FISCHER [00:22:16] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:17] I loved in the wedding. I loved so much that they're like, do you Phyllis take Bob Vance of Vance Refrigeration?

JENNA FISCHER [00:22:25] Yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:25] That's, like you're taking the whole thing.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:22:28] That's what's so great about that, I think it was in "The Merger" when she told, when she told Rashida that, you know, you don't know who Bob Vance is? You know? You got a lot to learn, Missy.

JENNA FISCHER [00:22:39] Yeah.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:22:41] And that's what's so funny about it, because Bob Vance is a big deal in that town, you know?

JENNA FISCHER [00:22:46] Yeah.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:22:47] So he was all, you know, it's all about Bob Vance Refrigeration. Everybody knew him. So.

JENNA FISCHER [00:22:53] Well, Phyllis is now the first lady of Vance Refrigeration. I mean, she's gonna play the part.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:22:58] Right. Right.

JENNA FISCHER [00:23:00] I'm sure she's gonna have to go to. I don't know. Is there ribbon cuttings involved with Vance Refrigeration? When they install, like, everything in a new restaurant or something?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:09] Yeah, I feel like there's a shopping mall where there's little like kind of stars like the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and Bob Vance gets one. And they, they all go to downtown Scranton.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:23:19] That's right. And then there has to be a commercial and she has to be in the commercial for Bob Vance.

JENNA FISCHER [00:23:23] Oh.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:23] Oh, I wish we could have filmed that.

JENNA FISCHER [00:23:25] Why did we never shoot that?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:28] Oh Ken, that is brilliant.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:23:32] Exactly.

JENNA FISCHER [00:23:33] Oh, that's the content we're missing. Ken, so we said before that you've directed nine episodes of "The Office". Do you have a favorite? Can you pick a favorite?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:42] Ooh, that's hard.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:23:43] You know what? It's, it's a toss up. I think between "Phyllis' Wedding", actually. And, and "Health Care". Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:52] Hot dog fingers.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:23:54] Yeah. "Health Care". Oh, my God. I can watch that over and over and over. I mean, it is-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:24:00] Same.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:24:01] And it was so, and what's so great about it. We were just, I think, I think we shot. We definitely shot within the first six. But we were all trying to figure out what the show was about it, you know, and trying to make it our own and trying different stuff and, and we were all getting used to each other. It was just, it was just great. I loved, I loved doing the, you know, being in the beginning of it because it was-. Did we shoot it? Was that the third episode we shot? Do you remember or?

JENNA FISCHER [00:24:27] You know, I think we shot that season a little out of order. So it might have been like it was the fifth episode we shot, but it was the third episode that aired.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:24:37] That aired. That's what it was. Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:24:39] But those were the early days. That was when we finally got six. And then they sent us home. You know?

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:24:45] Yeah. Exactly.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:24:45] So that was a really magical time.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:24:48] It really, really was. And everybody was so unsure about it. And, and I just remember walking away and just feeling so good about it, you know, just feeling so like, wow, that was really fun and different and great, and the cast was, it was, everybody was perfect. And I remember my agent saying, the next season came around and I saw that the, all the attention that it was getting from, from, from iTunes. And. And so I made sure I called my agent said, look, you got to get me back on that show. You know, that show is, you know, because I think it was up in the air, we didn't know if we were coming back or not.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:25:28] Oh yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:25:29] Yeah.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:25:29] Yeah. I said if they come back, I gotta be, I want to be involved in that show. So. So luckily, the college kids got us, you know, got us put on back. You know?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:25:39] The college kids and now the middle schoolers.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:25:43] Exactly.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:25:44] They're keeping us going.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:25:45] You know, what's funny is that that I still, I really lead with that, which when people ask me which shows, if I explain to somebody that I'm a director and they say, what shows have you done? Anything I know. And I goes, Well. Little show called "The Office". I'd brag about it. They're like, What? So I get a lot of props for that. I'm just so appreciative to be a part of that show. It is just such a, such a great show and it was the kind of show that you can just still watch over and over and over and still. And there's all these little subtleties. And just moments, you know, like we talked about Michael jumping up and down. And, you know, in the window, and looks like when, you know, when Pam and Roy were dancing and then, you know, Pam and Roy and then, and then, you know, Dwight, you and Dwight. You know, it was just, it was just really sweet, sweet moments. And you just, you know, just cherish those, those great moments.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:26:41] Ken, this was so lovely.

JENNA FISCHER [00:26:43] Thank you so much. And what are you up to now? I'm, well, now I know that you directed some "Bless Your Mess", which is the show that replaced my show.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:26:55] But if it makes you feel any better, we got cancelled too. So.

JENNA FISCHER [00:26:58] Oh well, I mean, I'm not saying I feel better.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:27:04] But yeah, I'm just some, I'm doing a new show with Jamie Foxx on, for Netflix is called "Dad, Stop Embarrassing Me". It's loosely based on him and his daughters relationship. And then in the fall, late fall now, I think after the election, I'm doing a show for NBC was Kenan Thompson, it's called "Wake Up with Kenan". And it's Kenan Thompson and Don Johnson and Maya Rudolph is a, has a, well Maya Rudolph, is, was his wife, and, but had passed away. So I think. So that's, it's basically the storyline, is he has a, he has a morning show and then he's taking care of two kids. And Don Johnson is his father-in-law.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:27:54] Oh, my gosh.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:27:56] Yeah. So, so let's see. It seems like it's going to be a lot of fun. I'm really looking forward to that.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:00] Well, Ken, you were so beloved by "The Office" cast. We, we have talked to so many of the cast members in doing this podcast. We reach out to people. Phyllis sent us in audio clips and she was like, oh, and it was Ken Whittingham and we always loved it when Ken was there. And just know that you have so much love for you from our cast, and Jenna and I would love for you to come back. So. So.

JENNA FISCHER [00:28:24] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:24] Come on back any time.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:28:26] Any time. I would love it. Any time.I love you guys and I miss you guys. And I even still think about you Jenna, I go, when I'm in Laguna, I go, did Jenna move down here? I wonder if she's around here.

JENNA FISCHER [00:28:37] Well we would spend how much time just talking about Laguna, moving to Laguna, looking up houses in Laguna. I have this dream of like one day moving to a beach house.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:50] Cashing out of L.A.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:28:52] Right.

JENNA FISCHER [00:28:52] Yeah. You are talking up Laguna.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:28:56] You know, it's really funny because right after I get off, when when I'm done with this, I'm going down there. My wife's down there now. So I'll be there.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:06] Oh, man.

JENNA FISCHER [00:29:06] Well, all of our love to you. Thanks for coming on today.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:09] Thanks, Ken.

KEN WHITTINGHAM [00:29:10] Thanks. Bye bye.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:11] Bye.

JENNA FISCHER [00:29:12] Bye.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:16] How fun was that?

JENNA FISCHER [00:29:18] He's the best.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:19] Well, let's give in to this episode, Jenna. We start with a cold open. It's a classic Jim prank. You know, Jim says he has to reboot his computer and it makes this chiming noise. And then he offers Dwight an Altoid. And then he keeps doing this over and over, sort of like that Pavlovian, you know, sort of experiment with Dwight.

JENNA FISCHER [00:29:37] Yes. And Jim's prank works.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:40] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:29:40] After several times of doing this, the ding goes off and Dwight immediately puts his hand out for a mint.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:47] And he doesn't know why.

JENNA FISCHER [00:29:48] Yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:49] He's just doing it on reflex.

JENNA FISCHER [00:29:50] Yes. So we got a lot of mail about this. Blakey, Emma, Kayla, Bethany and Elise all wrote in to say, "In the cold open of this episode, the scene is a montage of multiple days. Did John and Rainn have to constantly change outfits just to get this one scene"? Yes, they had a rack of clothes of all these different changes and they would film, go change, film, go change, film, go change. Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:30:18] Yeah. And all the while, wardrobe is keeping track and Veda onset. She's like keeping track of when they're in what outfit. And, so that they could just get it done.

JENNA FISCHER [00:30:28] But guys, it wasn't just John and Rainn. All the rest of us were in the background.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:30:32] Yes. Anyone that the camera saw had to change as well.

JENNA FISCHER [00:30:35] Well, I remember getting to work to shoot this cold open and there were like seven outfits in my trailer, which never happened. We would have one outfit. We would wear it every single day for five days.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:30:47] I mean, they washed it, guys, they washed it, you know?

JENNA FISCHER [00:30:50] Well, yeah, they washed it.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:30:50] Yeah. We wore the same thing every day.

JENNA FISCHER [00:30:52] Yeah. But to walk in and like, my little closet was totally full of all these clothes, I had to go back and look and be like, wait, what? Oh yeah. It's the cold open with the dinging computer.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:05] That's a great catch.

JENNA FISCHER [00:31:06] And then we just had this fun tidbit from Amanda Teege, who said, "My psychology professor used the cold open of this episode to teach us about the Pavlovian theory".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:17] Oh, my gosh. Well, last night I read up a lot about Pavlov. I'm not going to go into it. Here's-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:31:23] Oh no.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:23] Here's the first time I'm doing a deep dive and I'm like, you know what, you guys? It was fascinating. It's a whole podcast in itself.

JENNA FISCHER [00:31:29] Well, now I'm intrigued.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:30] OK, I will read one thing that I discovered. OK?

JENNA FISCHER [00:31:34] You know what? It's a shallow dive. Give me a shallow dive.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:37] Pavlov studied a lot about conditioning and how we react to things. How we can have involuntary reactions to stress or pain, or like the cues that, that Jim was doing to Dwight with the chime. And then you get a treat.

JENNA FISCHER [00:31:48] OK.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:48] This is the part I found a really fascinating. They began to study transmarginal inhibitions. The body's natural response of shutting down when exposed to overwhelming stress or pain. I mean, I guess-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:32:02] Like going into shock?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:04] Yeah. Yeah. Like when your body just shuts down. Research showed that different temperaments move through the responses at different times. I thought this was fascinating because, you know, something might happen traumatic in your life and you and the members of your family or your friends all experience it a little bit differently.

JENNA FISCHER [00:32:24] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:25] And you travel through stress and pain differently. Pavlov commented that the most basic inherited difference of people as they travel through stress and pain was how soon they reached the shutdown point and that people that are quick to shut down have a fundamentally different type of nervous system.

JENNA FISCHER [00:32:44] Like on a cellular level, they have a different nervous system.?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:48] I guess. This is why it needs a massive deep dive.

JENNA FISCHER [00:32:51] Well, that's a shallow dive that's making me want to dive into the deep end. I'm going to start ordering more books. I haven't gotten my books yet about Jan Levinson-Gould's name, psychology people yet, but I'm waiting.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:04] You have a lot to read, lady, you're gonna be very busy.

JENNA FISCHER [00:33:07] All right. Well, should we move into the meat of this episode? The spam of this episode?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:12] You reminded me when you said that, of like Michael, like, who wants my meat?

JENNA FISCHER [00:33:16] Yes. Let's get into the meat of this episode. We're at the church, Phyllis' wedding party is out on the steps being photographed. Michael is trying to squeeze himself into these pictures. The photographer does that great bit where he's like, you know what? Just, just Phyllis and her parents. But then also the bridesmaids and also you too. Basically names everyone but Michael. Well, people wrote in Sydney Papis, Henry Winguard, Tara S., James G., and Emily Lankshim all want to know who played Phyllis' bridesmaids and family. Were they all actors? Were any of them her real family members like Mindy's parents in "Diwali"? No, they were all actors. Her main sister that we see throughout the episode was played by Malie Flanagan, and the photographer in the scene was played by John F. Schaffer. So those are just a couple of the guest stars.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:34:15] You know, Malie Flanagan is a great improv sketch actress and she performed with Wayne Wilderson and Nancy Walls before she was Nancy Carell.

JENNA FISCHER [00:34:26] Omg. Well, next up, Michael explains that he is part of the wedding party because Phyllis has asked him to push her farther down the aisle. So he's basically giving away the bride. And it's, it's a big day for Phyllis, but it's, it's also just a really big day for him.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:34:46] He's employer of the bride.

JENNA FISCHER [00:34:48] Well, then Phyllis has a talking head explaining the reason why she asked Michael to be in the wedding.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:34:53] She said she is going to get a six week vacation.

JENNA FISCHER [00:34:57] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:34:58] A six week honeymoon. And that's never been done. So she had her motives.

JENNA FISCHER [00:35:03] Yeah. She did. And she's going to pay for it.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:06] She will.

JENNA FISCHER [00:35:06] This decision.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:08] Nothing comes for free, guys. Nothing comes for free.

JENNA FISCHER [00:35:10] Well then Pam has the talking head, where she says Phyllis used the same invitations as her and Roy. There's a big P and a big R.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:23] I have a question for you about this, because you hold it up.

JENNA FISCHER [00:35:26] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:26] I took a screengrab. I looked at it. So you remember your Save the Date that you handed Angela Martin in "Conflict Resolution"?

JENNA FISCHER [00:35:33] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:34] That was like shades of purple.

JENNA FISCHER [00:35:36] That was a Save the Date. That's different from an invitation.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:39] But didn't we say that Pam's bridesmaids, we're gonna have, like, lilac dresses or something at one point?

JENNA FISCHER [00:35:45] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:46] Like purple was her color. Purple's not here today, guys. There's orange turquoise.

JENNA FISCHER [00:35:50] Yeah, you're right.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:51] There's a big jump from whatever her Save the Date idea was to what her wedding was going to be.

JENNA FISCHER [00:35:56] Yeah, some changes were made. You're right.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:59] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:35:59] It ends up being more bluey. But then in Pam's wedding to Jim, she goes back to lilac.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:05] I know. I expected to see more purple, people. That's all I'm saying.

JENNA FISCHER [00:36:11] Well, then, Stanley, Jim and Karen arrive and we find out that they've both purchased toasters.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:19] Yes, I called it the dueling toasters. Stanley is really, really annoyed.

JENNA FISCHER [00:36:23] Charissa, Caitlin, Nicole, Kimberly and Angela all said, "Stanley bought Phyllis a toaster for her wedding present. Do you think it's the same toaster that he bought for Pam and Roy's wedding that he couldn't return and now he's regifting it"?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:38] 100 percent.

JENNA FISCHER [00:36:40] Yes, I think that's part of the joke.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:43] Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if it's in the same wrapping. He just put it on a shelf.

JENNA FISCHER [00:36:48] I feel like Karen and Jim checked the registry. They picked the toaster. Maybe Stanley checked the registry and he's like, oh, she wants a toaster, I've got a toaster over here, I need to unload.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:02] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:37:02] So imagine, you know, Jim and Karen's surprise, they're like, well, wait, it said it was still available on the registry.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:09] Yeah. What the heck?

JENNA FISCHER [00:37:10] I think that's why we get the dueling toasters.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:12] I love it. Next, Dwight and Angela arrive separately, but they run into each other in the parking lot. He tells her she looks as beautiful as the queen of England. This is apparently a very high compliment. Angela really loves it. And then she insists that they, they, you know, they can't walk in the same. And she's like, don't linger. Break left, left. And Jenna part of that was improvised because I remember that on the day. And Rainn and I had a lot of fun being so silly in that parking lot. But I have to talk a minute about my outfit.

JENNA FISCHER [00:37:46] Oh, well, you're going to make Hunter Sexton and Kennedy McCallister very happy because they want to know all about it.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:52] I remember wardrobe saying that this was vintage, that they, it was like a vintage suit that they found. It was very much like Jacqueline Kennedy, right?

JENNA FISCHER [00:38:00] Yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:00] Jacqueline Kennedy for her husband's inauguration, 1961, wore a pillbox hat and wore this cloth sort of wool coat. This was radical at the time. I looked it up because everyone would have been wearing mink. Mink coats, mink hats. And there's Jacqueline in, like, cloth and wool. It was like what?

JENNA FISCHER [00:38:20] Oh.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:21] And I forever in my brain thought that her pillbox hat and dress were a shade of blue on that day.

JENNA FISCHER [00:38:30] Are they not?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:31] No. No. So this was so cool. I looked up to see who made her hat. It was made by Halston. And when I did, I found out all of this information. Most people think it was blue because at the time, I guess, color film struggled to match real hues in photos. But this dress is actually at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. That's where this outfit is stored. And it is, in fact, beige. Beige.

JENNA FISCHER [00:39:01] Really?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:02] Not blue. She wore a beige pillbox hat and a beige coat.

JENNA FISCHER [00:39:08] Whoa.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:09] Yes. And if you look up this image, in so many images, it's blue. Except if you look at the cover of Life magazine from the inauguration, it is beige.

JENNA FISCHER [00:39:20] I mean, I'm a little surprised she wore beige to an inauguration.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:24] I know. I thought so, too. She did have a mink, what do you call it? That you put your hands in?

JENNA FISCHER [00:39:30] Stole.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:31] A stole. Is that what it's called.

JENNA FISCHER [00:39:32] Is it a stole?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:33] I don't know. Is it a muff? Is it a muff?

JENNA FISCHER [00:39:35] A muff? No muffs are for your ears. It's a hand warmer.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:39] It was like a. It was like a mink, brown mink ball and you put your hands in it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:39:47] Yes. I know exactly what you're talking about. I just-.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:52] You can tell you and I are on the cutting edge of fashion.

JENNA FISCHER [00:39:55] A mink ball. She had a mink ball.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:57] She had  mink ball. She put her hands on. And, and the collar of her coat was trimmed in the same color mink as the ball she put her hands in. But the whole outfit was beige. Very bold. And then the thing that Halston, I think would really want you to know, because he did an interview about it, is that he spent hours shaping that hat so he'd have a perfect rounded dome top. And then when she went outside, the wind began to blow and she had to put her hand on top to hold the hat and dented it in the middle.

JENNA FISCHER [00:40:24] Wait. Wait. The shape of the hat that I become like that's burned in my brain was a mistake because she had to flatten it.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:40:33] She had to hold it to her head. She didn't mean to. It was blowing off. So she grabbed it. And that action put a dent in it. And so it was photographed the whole entire day. This was right at the beginning as she walked out. So it was photograph the whole day with this dent in it. And I mean, within, you know, several days all across America, people were selling this dinted hat to match Jackie's pillbox hat.

JENNA FISCHER [00:40:59] I can not believe that her pillbox hat was supposed to be rounded.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:41:03] Oh, yeah. It was supposed to be like a little dome.

JENNA FISCHER [00:41:05] I have to say, I think God sent that wind that day because a domed hat would have just looked so silly.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:41:14] But a dinted hat.

JENNA FISCHER [00:41:14] I think, I think the dent was the right move. I don't know.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:41:19] All right, Halston, put on your earmuffs.

JENNA FISCHER [00:41:21] I'm just saying, sometimes there are acts of serendipity.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:41:25] Jenna thinks the dent was ordained.

JENNA FISCHER [00:41:27] I don't know. Well, after this scene, Angela, we have a Dwight talking head that will become so relevant and important later at the end of the series. He explains that the Schrutes have a tradition of getting married while standing in their own graves. And we are not going to forget this later when Dwight finally marries.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:41:49] We'll get there. But people had to help me in that hole.

JENNA FISCHER [00:41:52] Well, so everyone sort of filtering in, they're signing the guest book, yada, yada. In the meantime, Michael is checking in on Phyllis. He comes into the room. He wants to make sure she's all right.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:42:10] Yeah. He's really taken his role seriously.

JENNA FISCHER [00:42:13] As employer of the bride. This scene is absolutely fantastic. It's famous. It's famous, you know, Ken talked a little bit about how much they laughed while they were doing this scene. We had a lot of people write in Kat, Merilee, Emily, Stephanie and Dan all wanted to know if any of the Michael and Phyllis dialog in this dressing room scene was improvised. Specifically the word "pungent". Well, guys, that was all in the script. They performed this almost exactly as scripted. I think that just tells you how well written the scene is. But we had to ask Phyllis what it was like to film this scene.

PHYLLIS SMITH [00:42:56] That scene was unbelievable. We had the best time. We, I don't know how many times we had to stop to start over because there was one word in particular that we just could not get through. And that was "pungent". Every time Steve said the word "pungent", he would break out into this high pitched cackle. And then I would start laughing. And then all of a sudden we heard the Video Village and the sound people outside the door because we were in a small dressing room area with just the camera guy and a sound boom. I don't-, I'm not even sure if the boom guy was in there. So we could hear them cackling and laughing on the outside. So we had to stop. They had to move. They had to go down to the bottom of the stairs and set up down there. I couldn't breathe. I was laughing so hard I couldn't breathe. He was laughing so hard. And we took, I don't know, I don't know how many times we started over. And it was all because of the word "pungent". It's so, pungent, it makes me laugh to think of it now. And the only way I found, 'cause I didn't want to keep ruining a scene from laughing, you know? And the only way I got through that scene was to hold my breath. When I wasn't talking. I literally had to suck it up and hold my breath. Otherwise, I just, we couldn't get through it. It was, it's a very fond memory and one of the best that I can have in my entire life. It was a great few moments there. So when you hear the word "pungent", know that all hell broke loose every time we said it.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:47] Oh man, I love that so much.

JENNA FISCHER [00:44:49] I know, I know.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:50] This scene made us laugh at the table read and then it made us fall apart when we watched it. What really got me was the word "pungent", but it was the breath that Steve took before he said it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:45:03] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:45:04] Oh, man, I wish I could have been a fly on the wall. I would have ruined the takes, even as a fly. Oh, my gosh.

JENNA FISCHER [00:45:11] Well, you know, this scene was supposed to go on.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:45:15] Yes.

JENNA FISCHER [00:45:15] Bob Vance is supposed to come to the door.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:45:18] Yes, it's in the deleted scenes on the DVD.

JENNA FISCHER [00:45:21] Oh, my gosh. Well, I guess they couldn't get through that part either.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:45:25] Bob comes to the door and he's like, you know, Michael's there. And Michael's like, that-. And he's like, oh, what does that smell? And Michael's like, that was Phyllis. She, she has some nerves, some wedding jitters. And Phyllis is like, it's not me. And Bob was like, I'm going to go.

JENNA FISCHER [00:45:45] Oh, my gosh, I wish that was still in the episode. I have to say.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:45:49] It's really funny. All right. Well, now Michael has a talking head that, you know, believe it or not, he's only ever been to one other wedding. Jenna, this made me sad.

JENNA FISCHER [00:45:59] Oh. The whole-. I can't deal with Michael's childhood.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:46:02] I know. It rips you up.

JENNA FISCHER [00:46:04] It's too much for me.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:46:05] Well, he's only been to one other wedding and it was his mom getting married to Jeff.

JENNA FISCHER [00:46:10] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:46:11] And there's a flashback video. It looks like maybe he peed in his pants.

JENNA FISCHER [00:46:15] Yes. Walking down the aisle as the ring bearer.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:46:18] And he runs out and he says, I hate you, and anyway. It's clearly a traumatic experience for him. And Michael is carrying all of that in now to only the second wedding he's ever been to.

JENNA FISCHER [00:46:31] Yeah, there's, there's so much. This. This scene is really important because it's meant to justify why Michael behaves the way he does all day. You know, Michael's trying to heal an old wound here.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:46:45] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:46:46] He's trying to make up for the one other horrible wedding he's ever been to. You know, I feel like this is very relatable. If you had a horrible experience back in high school, but now you've made it big and you're going back to your reunion, you're trying to make up for all that lost time. And I think that's a little similar here with Michael.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:06] I think the other thing going on here, too, is that once again, Michael sees his coworkers as his family. So he really thinks he has a bigger role in this wedding than he does.

JENNA FISCHER [00:47:17] Yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:18] So now folks are entering the church, right? They're arriving for the ceremony. And Dwight and Jim have this exchange. Dwight's like, who are all these people?

JENNA FISCHER [00:47:28] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:28] He clearly doesn't like crowds.

JENNA FISCHER [00:47:30] He says he has this line. He says we need a new plague. There's too many people.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:35] Did you say plague?

JENNA FISCHER [00:47:38] Plague.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:39] Plague. There's an A. Have you said plague your whole life?

JENNA FISCHER [00:47:42] Yeah. Plague. We need a new plague.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:44] Oh my God.

JENNA FISCHER [00:47:45] I'm just saying plague.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:47] Plague. It's a plague.

JENNA FISCHER [00:47:50] Plague. I'm saying plague.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:52] I cannot believe I'm saying something correctly and you're not. This is. Let's go buy a lottery ticket. Anything can happen.

JENNA FISCHER [00:48:01] All right. He says we need a new plague.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:04] Thank you.

JENNA FISCHER [00:48:05] Well, we had a fan question from Brianna Everett who wants to know because it's feeling very relevant now. "Did Dwight improvise that line about the plague"? No, that was scripted.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:20] I mean, this episode was really well-written. It really was. So there's, I feel like there's a lot of lines that feel like they're improvised, but they were written.

JENNA FISCHER [00:48:27] That was written.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:28] So now Dwight has this in his head that people are crashing the wedding and he's going to have to go find them, Jenna. He's a man on a mission and everyone else is arriving and they're sort of like mingling and talking.

JENNA FISCHER [00:48:40] Yes. Kevin introduces himself to Toby's date, who he does not believe Toby met at the gym. He's like basically implying she's a hired escort.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:52] This is classic pervy Kevin.

JENNA FISCHER [00:48:54] We had some fan questions from Kassidy Hill, Alison Lolas and Liza Rice. "Is Toby's date a hired escort? Or did Toby really meet this beautiful woman at a gym? And why don't we ever see her again"? Well, I'll tell you, I don't know why we never see her again. Well, there was a talking head in the script. After she catches the bouquet at the end, Toby says that she's a pediatric nurse.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:22] Yes.

JENNA FISCHER [00:49:22] But that was cut out of the episode.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:25] That is in the DVD box set.

JENNA FISCHER [00:49:26] There you go. So it was a deleted scene.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:29] I believe that she's a pediatric nurse.

JENNA FISCHER [00:49:31] Yeah. Well, also, we have a quick moment, a little joke that I really like, which is that Kelly has worn white to the wedding.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:37] It looks like a wedding dress.

JENNA FISCHER [00:49:39] With a tiara.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:40] I know.

JENNA FISCHER [00:49:41] Yeah. Tiara. Tiara.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:43] I'm gonna let that one slide.

JENNA FISCHER [00:49:44] All right. Well, now it is Michael's moment. He's about to walk Phyllis down the aisle. He's about to start pushing Albert.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:55] Yes, folks. Did you hear that? Elbert. I got into a big debate with my family. They were positive that he was saying Albert. I said, no, it's Elbert. I know I'm hearing Elbert.

JENNA FISCHER [00:50:05] It's a weird because her father's name is Albert. And then there's Uncle Al.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:50:11] But it's Elbert.

JENNA FISCHER [00:50:13] Elbert. Correct.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:50:15] Thank you.

JENNA FISCHER [00:50:15] Well, as the doors open, we reveal Phyllis in her wedding dress. And Pam turns to camera and says, "Oh, my God. That's my dress". So she has stolen the invitations. And now her wedding dress. We had a fan question, Angela, from Kaylee Connolly. And I'm gonna need your input here.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:50:38] OK.

JENNA FISCHER [00:50:39] She says, "Throughout this episode, Pam realizes that Phyllis has stolen all of her wedding details and then she's wearing the same dress. Well, in the season finale, Angela looks like she's wearing the same dress that Phyllis wore in her wedding to Dwight. Was this planned"?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:51:01] OK. So I wrote this down too. You guys, when we were watching it. I was watching it with the kids. I said, oh, my gosh, that's my dress. Then, and then the kids were like, no, you mean it's Pam's dress? I said, no, it's my dress. And I have all these photos on my phone. I took a ton of photos for the finale, Jenna, of my wardrobe fitting. All of it. It is almost identical. I don't think this was planned, obviously. I don't think Angela Martin would try to emulate Phyllis' dress. I think it was by chance. But, but you guys, it is so similar. I had a little lace shawl jacket thing. It didn't come long sleeve. Like Phyllis goes all the way to her, her wrists, you know? Mine went sort of just to the elbow area. And then we had a strapless kind of dress. I do not have a broad ribbon band on mine like hers, but it's super similar.

JENNA FISCHER [00:51:56] I looked it up too. I had pictures side by side on my computer. They are so, it's like the cut of the dress is so similar.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:52:05] Crazy. I know. OK, so they're walking down the aisle and as they get about halfway down, Elbert is sort of moved to stand up. He's like he wants to try. Right?

JENNA FISCHER [00:52:15] It's his daughter's wedding.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:52:17] And Phyllis is so delighted. She, she just starts to smile and everyone applauds. And Michael is like, no frickinâ€™ way. He had one job. He had one job. And they just took it away from him.

JENNA FISCHER [00:52:32] Yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:52:33] And he just reverts back to that little boy who didn't get to walk down the aisle with the rings and the dog took his spot.

JENNA FISCHER [00:52:39] So Michael is just watching Phyllis and her father walked down the aisle to all of this applause. What he does is just sort of awkwardly pushes slash drags the wheelchair down the aisle.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:52:55] Behind them.

JENNA FISCHER [00:52:56] Yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:52:57] So here's my question, Jenna, because you have the script. I sort of figured in the script it would say Michael awkwardly walks behind them. Was that dragging of the wheelchair, was that Steve or was that in the script?

JENNA FISCHER [00:53:09] Oh, Angela, you are not the only person to wonder.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:53:11] Oh.

JENNA FISCHER [00:53:12] So I did look this up because Camille, Sarah, Dylan, Meghan and Katie all asked the same question. Yes, it was scripted. Here's what it says in the script. It says, "Michael can't figure out how to undo the lock on the wheelchair. So he drags it down while still doing a traditional wedding walk".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:53:33] Amazing.

JENNA FISCHER [00:53:34] Yeah. So all of that of him doing the, like, step together, step together. That was, you know, a script note.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:53:43] Well, we asked Phyllis about this moment, and here's what she had to say.

PHYLLIS SMITH [00:53:46] One of the scenes that stood out in my mind was when I was walking down the aisle. And since I've never been married, to me, that was a real thrill. And then Michael. Steve. Michael. When he started dragging the wheelchair after my dad had gotten up and was going to walk me down the aisle and Michael was dragging the wheelchair, I could not keep a straight face. And I was so happy that the majority of the time my back was to that, to that action because it was just hard to, to keep it in. Just the sound of the wheelchair dragging down the aisle.

JENNA FISCHER [00:54:28] I remember that. I remember it was very hard to get through.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:54:31] Jenna, I don't know if you remember, but I sat directly behind you.

JENNA FISCHER [00:54:34] No.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:54:35] Yes. And we were tickled because between scenes we could turn around and chat to each other.

JENNA FISCHER [00:54:38] Well, it's funny because someone pointed out that it seemed like all of the Dunder Mifflin employees were on one side except for Pam.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:54:47] Yes.

JENNA FISCHER [00:54:47] Usually there's a bright side and a grim side, but I guess we sat on the groom's side.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:54:52] But I do remember I have such a memory of how beautiful the back of your hair looked. It looks so beautiful.

JENNA FISCHER [00:54:59] Oh. I watched this episode and I just thought I looked fantastic.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:55:03] You did.

JENNA FISCHER [00:55:04] I'm just going to say. I was like, oh, my gosh.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:55:07] You did.

JENNA FISCHER [00:55:08] My hair looks amazing. That dress, that color, that chocolaty colored dress.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:55:12] I'd never seen you in that color before. Personally.

JENNA FISCHER [00:55:14] Why don't I wear that color more is what I thought.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:55:17] I don't know. I feel like that color inspired me because that was the color of the dress I wore to the Golden Globes. Remember that time when we met Ben Affleck?

JENNA FISCHER [00:55:26] Yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:55:27] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:55:29] Yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:55:30] Yes. I was like, if Pam can wear it, I can wear it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:55:32] Well, I noticed something else about the wedding guests.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:55:36] What?

JENNA FISCHER [00:55:37] No, Gino and Leo. Bob Vance did not seem to invite any employees. So Phyllis invited all of her work friends, but I didn't see a big bunch of Vance refrigeration people.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:55:51] Well, you only know two of them, really.

JENNA FISCHER [00:55:53] Gino and Leo.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:55:54] Maybe Phyllis was like, those two will do something. They're always up to something. They're on my list now. They're on my no list.

JENNA FISCHER [00:56:02] Yeah, well, I'm sure Bob was like, we're inviting Michael, but I can't bring Gino and Leo? I don't think Bob cared. Well, I don't know if you noticed in the line of groomsmen standing up there. There are a set of twins. Those are meant to be Bob's grown sons.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:56:20] Oh.

JENNA FISCHER [00:56:20] It's in the script that Bob's twin sons are standing up for him, so he has his best friend. And, who gives a little bit of a speech later. And then his twin sons. And then I don't know who the other man is meant to be, but no Gino and Leo.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:56:36] So Phyllis is now a step mom.

JENNA FISCHER [00:56:38] Yeah. The minister is trying to finish the vows. But Michael jumps the gun and he pronounces Bob and Phyllis man and wife.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:56:47] He had to get something in there.

JENNA FISCHER [00:56:49] And it's crickets because the vows aren't finished, everyone.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:56:52] You know what the best job for Michael would have been? Is if he could have just been the DJ at the reception.

JENNA FISCHER [00:56:58] Just be the person who announces them in.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:57:01] Yes.

JENNA FISCHER [00:57:01] "For the first time, I'd like to introduce to you".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:57:05] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:57:05] Yes, that could have been it. Give him a microphone.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:57:08] It would be like at "The Dundees" for him all over again. He could be like, "And now for the first dance". And all of that.

JENNA FISCHER [00:57:13] Well, I don't know. I don't know if you should give Michael a microphone, as we will see soon.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:57:18] Oh, yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:57:19] Well, you, you know what, Angela? I always like to give shout outs to our guest actors. The minister was played by Rick Scarry. And Michael does finally get it right. Everyone cheers. And he's, he's a little happy with that moment. He's like, oh, good.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:57:34] And he should have just left it alone. He had his moment, Michael. But Michael can't leave it alone, you guys.

JENNA FISCHER [00:57:40] No. And it's all going to blow up at the reception.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:57:45] "Roxanne".

JENNA FISCHER [00:57:47] All right. Well, let's take a break. And when we come back, we'll talk about what happens. All right. So we are back. We're about to go to Phyllis and Bob's reception. And Angela, it is really hitting me that we were on location this entire episode.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:58:05] Jenna. I wrote about it in my journal. I said, "We were on location all week and we got to spend a lot of time in our trailers together because we had no, quote, 'office set' to call home. Oscar and I, Oscar and I played music and danced in my trailer. Oh, and John's trailer was Hangout Central. The guys were playing Madden Football in there and we went, us gals, and hung out in there too. Rainn actually attempted to teach me how to play Madden".

JENNA FISCHER [00:58:33] Oh.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:58:33] "I was horrible. And he was so patient. At one point our second A.D. was trying to find us all. And when he came to John's trailer, it was John, Rainn, Jenna, Rashida and me. Us gals took turns hosting lunch. Today I hosted and I realized I spent the morning sprucing up my trailer. Isn't that crazy? I cleaned it and then I lit a candle like I was at home having people over for dinner".

JENNA FISCHER [00:58:58] Of course you did. Oh my gosh, this is so cute. I think the thing that's striking me, Angela, is that it's true how little time we spent in our trailers when we were back on our Dunder Mifflin set because we would just hang out at our desks.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:59:12] Yes.

JENNA FISCHER [00:59:12] Between scenes.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:59:13] Exactly. That's why I said, we didn't have our office desks. So.

JENNA FISCHER [00:59:17] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:59:18] And I know a lot of these scenes, Jenna, if we weren't in them, they really wanted us to go to our trailer because they didn't want, you know, they, they didn't want to be looking for us all throughout the church. So when we weren't in scenes, they wanted us to go to our little base camp area.

JENNA FISCHER [00:59:33] And we didn't do as much background work in this episode as you might think. They really crafted these shots. And Ken kind of talked about that. He had a very specific shot lists and he knew exactly what he wanted to see and when he wanted to see it. So if you weren't a part of that storytelling, you were back in the trailer.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:59:51] Yeah. Learning how to play Madden Football from Rainn Wilson.

JENNA FISCHER [00:59:54] I guess so. Now that you bring it up, I have a vague memory of Rainn very patiently trying to teach you all the buttons on that controller.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:00:03] I was horrible.

JENNA FISCHER [01:00:05] Back at the reception, I guess on the way into the reception. They have a traditional receiving line. Everyone walks through. You have a nice little moment with Phyllis.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:00:15] Yes, I say that her dress is so white, it's almost blinding.

JENNA FISCHER [01:00:19] I think I know what the implication is there.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:00:21] Yes, but did you notice that I have little lace gloves on?

JENNA FISCHER [01:00:24] No.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:00:25] Yes. And I had to wear them the whole week and they drove me crazy.

JENNA FISCHER [01:00:30] Well, you know, they would especially drive you crazy today because you cannot wear lace gloves and operate a smartphone.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:00:37] Oh, right. I wouldn't be able to swipe up or do anything.

JENNA FISCHER [01:00:40] No, that was my first thought. My first thought when you told me that. But then my other thought is where they itchy?

ANGELA KINSEY [01:00:46] There were a little too long for my fingers. So I had this little like floppy bit. And then-.

JENNA FISCHER [01:00:50] That's what she said.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:00:53] I have a deleted talking head where I show up to the church and it's one of the craziest shots. I meant to bring it up to Ken, dang it. It's like he put the camera on the ground, Jenna. And it's shooting up from the asphalt, like under my chin. It's not super flattering and I'm looking down in a high above my head is the cross in the steeple of the church. It's a very dramatic talking head where I basically say, you know, I like traditional weddings, so let's see what this one's going to be like. And as I'm doing it, I'm, I have black gloves on and I'm taking them off slowly and as I do underneath are my lace gloves.

JENNA FISCHER [01:01:34] I adore that detail. That is very funny. So people are milling about. People are kind of like, you know, checking out the food, they're walking around. Kelly finds Pam.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:01:49] Mmhmm.

JENNA FISCHER [01:01:50] And she is like, oh, my God, you must be so miserable right now.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:01:56] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [01:01:56] And Pam's like, I'm fine. I'm OK. And she's like, well, she would be freaking out and getting drunk and telling someone she's pregnant.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:02:05] Mmhmm. Pam's like-.

JENNA FISCHER [01:02:06] Pam's like, that's a lot of good ideas.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:02:09] I feel like Kelly is a frenemy. I feel like she's one of those types of gals. Like, clearly, Pam is noticing all of this. She really doesn't want anyone to then, like, rub it in her face. But she's like, oh, my God. Are you so bummed out? Because they totally took your wedding and Roy's here and Jim's with someone else. I would be miserable.

JENNA FISCHER [01:02:27] Yes, but it's all under the guise of like, are you OK?

ANGELA KINSEY [01:02:30] Yeah. She doesn't care.

JENNA FISCHER [01:02:32] How are you?

ANGELA KINSEY [01:02:32] She doesn't care if you're OK.

JENNA FISCHER [01:02:34] No. No. This is a gossip moment.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:02:37] Yeah, well, Dwight is determined to find the wedding crashers. Dwight finds an elderly guest at the buffet. He's like putting a roll in his pocket. I respect that move. I have put bread in my purse before.

JENNA FISCHER [01:02:50] I've done it too.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:02:52] Yeah, but-.

JENNA FISCHER [01:02:53] Many times.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:02:54] Many times. I've done it with you.

JENNA FISCHER [01:02:55] I don't like to be without food. I want to have a snack on me at all times.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:03:00] OK. So Dwight thinks he's a wedding crasher. He starts asking him all these questions and the man is confused and Dwight's like, that's it. And kicks him out.

JENNA FISCHER [01:03:09] He kicks him out. And that's when Michael checks in with Phyllis. Who's like, is everything OK? He, he mentions he sent back the chicken because it was undercooked. Phyllis is like it was fish. He's like, I'm on it. Well, we had a fan question from Ashley Brooks. She wanted to know, "Did either of you have a funny story or a wild card guest like Michael at your weddings"? You know, I didn't. But two people did have sex in the bushes at my wedding.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:03:40] I know one of them. It wasn't me.

JENNA FISCHER [01:03:42] Well, I know both of them because they were guests at my wedding and they didn't come together.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:03:48] What? Oh.

JENNA FISCHER [01:03:50] Oh! That sounded weird. I don't know that much, I don't know that many details about their, about their rendezvous.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:03:59] Did you see? I was like a deer in headlights. I was like, what?

JENNA FISCHER [01:04:02] Oh dear. No, no, no.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:04:05] They didn't arrive to the wedding.

JENNA FISCHER [01:04:06] Wedding. Together.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:04:07] They hooked up at your wedding.

JENNA FISCHER [01:04:09] Yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:04:10] OK, well, I can tell you at my wedding we didn't have a random guest, but my husband really, really, really wanted to have a signature drink. He was so excited about it. And-.

JENNA FISCHER [01:04:21] I love a signature drive.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:04:23] I know. He did too. I was like, eh. But he wanted, he likes a Moscow mule. So he wanted to have the Moscow mule, but he wanted to use, is it bourbon? I'm going to get this wrong. It's actually called a Kentucky mule. They make it a little different. But he wanted everyone as their wedding favor to get a copper mug. Do you remember this Jenna?

JENNA FISCHER [01:04:44] I love my copper mug.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:04:45] OK, you took yours home.

JENNA FISCHER [01:04:48] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:04:48] I told Josh, I was like, Josh. People are not going to realize they can take them home. They're not. And he's like, yes, they will. We'll say it's the party favor. They get to take a copper mine home. Engraved on it was like our wedding date. I was like, babe? This is really nice. People are not going to take them home. And we got into a fight about it. It was planning the wedding. Guess what?

JENNA FISCHER [01:05:09] What?

ANGELA KINSEY [01:05:09] We have 55 copper mugs.

JENNA FISCHER [01:05:13] Oh, no. Well, Lee and I both took our mugs home. I knew that that was your wedding favor. Probably because you told me.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:05:22] We had a sign. Also, we had a sign. It had your, your table where you went to get seated, tied in a ribbon with your name. And they said this, this copper mug is yours to take home.

JENNA FISCHER [01:05:33] Now, to be fair, Angela, if you had been a guest at your own wedding, would you have read the sign and taken home your mug?

ANGELA KINSEY [01:05:41] Jenna, when it comes to getting free things, I read.

JENNA FISCHER [01:05:45] OK.  That's it.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:05:46] You know what I wouldn't have read? The instructions on where to park.

JENNA FISCHER [01:05:50] That's correct.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:05:51] I would have circled around until I figured it out. But I would have known to take the copper mug home.

JENNA FISCHER [01:05:56] Fair enough. All right. Well, now we have some big news. Scrantonicity is going to be playing at Phyllis' reception.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:06:06] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [01:06:06] She hired Kevin's band, Scrantonicity. It's their third gig. Their previous two gigs were for members of their own band. But before they begin playing their set, Kevin asked the crowd, has anyone seen Uncle Al? He has dementia and his family is really worried about him.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:06:28] "Roxanne".

JENNA FISCHER [01:06:28] And then he immediately launches into "Roxanne".

ANGELA KINSEY [01:06:31] The timing of that is so perfect.

JENNA FISCHER [01:06:34] Well, Angela, we got a lot of questions about the band. Becky, Hidasa, Marie, Sam and Sara all wanted to know, "Was it really Brian Baumgartner's singing at the wedding? And was he really playing the drums? Yes and yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:06:47] Yes and yes. And he practiced, you guys. He took it really seriously. He worked so hard on that. And I thought he did such a great job.

JENNA FISCHER [01:06:56] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:06:57] Well, I have an observation, Jenna. Wasn't this also the band that was going to play at Pam's wedding?

JENNA FISCHER [01:07:03] Yep.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:07:03] So put it on the list.

JENNA FISCHER [01:07:06] Put it on the list. And speaking of, Roy is about to find Pam and he tells her he is so impressed by all the details at this wedding and that Phyllis has such great taste.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:07:18] Well, Jenna, there is a deleted scene. It's fantastic. Phyllis comes up to Pam at the reception, and is like, hey, you might have noticed that Bob and I used the same after dinner mints like party favor from your wedding that you had planned. I hope that's OK. And you're like, basically Pam's like, uh, just the mints? So, wait, can you play it, Sam? I recorded it.

PHYLLIS SMITH [01:07:42] Are you enjoying yourself?

JENNA FISCHER [01:07:43] Oh, yeah. I'm having a great time.

PHYLLIS SMITH [01:07:46] Good. You know, I don't know if you noticed, but Bob, can I borrow your idea for the after dinner mints you were going to have at your wedding?

JENNA FISCHER [01:07:52] Oh, yeah. That and also everything. I mean, the dress and the flowers and the fish and the cake.

PHYLLIS SMITH [01:08:04] You really sound like you're keeping track.

JENNA FISCHER [01:08:07] Oh, I just.

PHYLLIS SMITH [01:08:07] You know, I could make an announcement if what you want is credit.

JENNA FISCHER [01:08:12] No, I.

PHYLLIS SMITH [01:08:15] Ok, well maybe we should just move on.

JENNA FISCHER [01:08:18] Oh, that is amazing.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:08:18] I mean, how passive aggressive is that? "Would you like me to make an announcement so you can get credit"? It's so amazing.

JENNA FISCHER [01:08:26] Well, we asked Phyllis about this particular storyline, and she actually had some thoughts on the matter. So, Sam, play the clip.

PHYLLIS SMITH [01:08:36] Pam said, you know, that I stole her, everything about her wedding, that I had stolen it, and that I think the writers kind of like to, like to write Phyllis kind of snarky sometimes. Well, when I got to thinking about it, I don't think that Phyllis Vance, Phyllis Lapin Vance stole Pam's ideas and colors and flowers and stuff because she was being vindictive. I think that Phyllis had an admiration for Pam and I thought if Pam likes those colors, then those must be pretty special. So it, that was always kind of a back story in my mind that I wasn't being nasty, that I was being, you know, kind of honoring Pam's, Pam's wishes for her ill fated wedding. But she ended up having a great wedding, didn't she?

JENNA FISCHER [01:09:36] Aw.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:09:37] That is just Phyllis being Phyllis.

JENNA FISCHER [01:09:40] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:09:41] Phyllis Smith is so sweet. I do think Phyllis Lapin with a little, a little shady.

JENNA FISCHER [01:09:46] Yes, I think so too. But it also kind of explains that snarky comment. You know, if that was where she was coming from of like, well, I was just. I admired your choices, but I guess if you need a bunch of credit, you know?

ANGELA KINSEY [01:10:02] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [01:10:03] Well, I think it's sweet because it really speaks to how much Pam shared with Phyllis about her wedding planning. And you see little snippets of that, where Phyllis is showing an interest, like they're in the kitchen, then Jim walks in. But this is the person that Pam could share with at work and was probably the only person who took an interest in her wedding. So I think that's why it was especially surprising to Pam where she was like, oh.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:10:29] Yeah. Oh, yeah. Angela Martin didn't need to hear about your wedding. She probably judged you for doing work on it at work.

JENNA FISCHER [01:10:35] She did. I think there's, you have a whole thing where you come down on me about it.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:10:40] I know.

JENNA FISCHER [01:10:41] All right. So now it's time for the speeches, everyone. Bob's best man, Randy, finishes up his speech and Michael jumps up. He has an amazing line. He's got a 40 minute speech planned.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:10:54] Yeah. All-.

JENNA FISCHER [01:10:56] He's going to be your host for the next 40 minutes.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:10:58] And it's all like on napkins.

JENNA FISCHER [01:11:00] Well, a lot of people wanted to know how much of Michael's toast was improvised. Crystal, Sammy, Sarah, Aubrey and Regan all asked. "Also, was it hard to keep a straight face"? Well, almost all of that speech was scripted. And yes, it's always hard to keep a straight face, but Phyllis had a different take on this. Here's what she had to say.

PHYLLIS SMITH [01:11:24] Any time Michael opened his mouth, it was hard to keep a straight face. And at that point in the script, he was kind of hurtful. But he didn't even know it. So I didn't really have to, to strain to keep a straight face on, on that particular scene because I was so hurt that he was saying all those crummy things about me. Some true, but some not. No, no.

JENNA FISCHER [01:11:53] Yeah, I love that Phyllis is like, no, I was so in the moment playing being hurt. And this reminds me of her scene in the first Christmas episode when Michael was so rude to her about her homemade oven mitt. And all the rest of us were just cracking up and Phyllis stayed in character. She was hurt and she didn't break.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:12:17] No, she's a total pro. I mean, she really took all of her, all of the different moments of the script that she was in. She really, really played it honest.

JENNA FISCHER [01:12:27] Well, I want to give a shout out here to Bob's best man. He was played by Brian Douglas Hatton and he's been in a bunch of stuff, including a recurring role as a detective on "Monk". It's another "Monk" person.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:12:41] Another "Office" "Monk" crossover.

JENNA FISCHER [01:12:43] There you go.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:12:44] Well, I have to point out something that's so ridiculous. But, you know, it is my way. Michael continues his speech and says that their couple celebrity name would be Phylob.

JENNA FISCHER [01:12:54] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:12:57] I looked it up. I was like, when did people start doing this, like combining the names? And this is what the Internet said, guys. The first time a celebrity couples named was combined was Bennifer.

JENNA FISCHER [01:13:12] I was going to say Bennifer.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:13:13] Yes.

JENNA FISCHER [01:13:14] Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:13:17] How does everyone know this? This is like a unanimous thought online that Bennifer first started it all.

JENNA FISCHER [01:13:20] I knew it.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:13:21] There you go.

JENNA FISCHER [01:13:22] The next one after Bennifer was Brangelina.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:13:25] Yes. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. And then I guess there's one for Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. And it's Kimyi.

JENNA FISCHER [01:13:32] Oh, yeah, Kimyi. I've heard that.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:13:34] I haven't heard that.

JENNA FISCHER [01:13:36] That one is not quite in my vernacular as much as Bennifer and Brangelina.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:13:41] Well.

JENNA FISCHER [01:13:42] But some people pointed out that, you know, Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston would have also been a Bennifer. No, they would have been a Brennifer. Well, after he does their name mashup. He goes on to do what I think he thinks is like a fun, playful kind of roast of Phyllis, where he tells everyone that her nickname in high school was Easy Rider. Well, that's it for Bob. Bob's like, you're out of here, buddy. And he takes the microphone and he throws Michael out of the wedding as Michael screams, "I hate you". This is the second time he screamed, "I hate you" at a wedding.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:14:21] This is full circle for him now. He's the little boy all over again, not getting to be part of the wedding. Groomsmen out there. If Jenna and I can impart anything on you, don't roast the bride.

JENNA FISCHER [01:14:34] Yeah, good one.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:14:36] It never goes well.

JENNA FISCHER [01:14:38] No. It's her day.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:14:40] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [01:14:40] Let her have her day.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:14:41] Yeah. You can roast the groom. Don't roast the bride.

JENNA FISCHER [01:14:44] All right. We've got a bunch of little moments. And we talked with Ken about this. This. We kind of move into like the rest of the storytelling here in this episode is done in these, like-.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:14:54] Little vignettes.

JENNA FISCHER [01:14:56] We have Jim kind of comes up to Pam and is like, why aren't you going to dance? And it's, it's a little bit of a flirty moment.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:15:02] A little bit? He says, you look cute. It's a total flirt moment.

JENNA FISCHER [01:15:06] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:15:06] And Pam knows it's a flirt moment. So now she's like, oh. But then, you know, he's off dancing with Karen.

JENNA FISCHER [01:15:12] This is a series of moments where Jim and Pam both kind of get their hopes up and then gets their, get their hopes dashed.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:15:20] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [01:15:20] Michael tries to sneak back in the wedding, but Dwight won't let him in.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:15:24] Dwight's so pleased. He's so pleased to be kicking him out.

JENNA FISCHER [01:15:27] And then Pam is sort of sulking in a corner and you hear "You Were Meant for Me" by Jewel. And Roy comes up to Pam and is like, oh, my gosh, they're playing our song. And she's like, yeah, it's so weird. I thought they only played The Police. And he's like, well, I gave him 20 bucks. Do you want to dance?

ANGELA KINSEY [01:15:47] Pam is very moved by this.

JENNA FISCHER [01:15:48] It's thoughtful.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:15:50] It is thoughtful and Roy's really making an effort. And they go and they dance together.

JENNA FISCHER [01:15:55] And then the camera pans and we see Angela and Dwight have sneaked off and they are dancing together.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:16:03] Yes. So you guys, this shot was really fun to do. We had to do it at night. So we did it one evening. It was outside. And Ken, when he had scouted the whole church, found this backdoor that then had steps that led down. Right? And so we decided to film it there. Those steps actually faced the street, which was a busy street, and we didn't have it blocked off. No one was crossing the street. So was just people going about their evening. And as we slow danced in one take, a car drove by with the windows down and they went, "Oh, my God, Dwight! Dwight! Angela"! We had to do the take over again.

JENNA FISCHER [01:16:47] That's amazing. Oh, my gosh, I love that. After this dance, Roy is like, hey, do you want to get out of here? And Pam says, Yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:16:55] Oh. And they walk off and they're holding hands and Jim sees it and it just hits you like a ton of bricks. When he watches her leave with him. And then he has a talking head where's he's like, you know what? I'm glad I'm here with Karen.

JENNA FISCHER [01:17:11] Yeah, yeah. And then we have a few moments, Karen singing with the band. Rashida mentioned this when she came on the podcast that she was so nervous to have to sing.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:17:23] She could not have been more adorable in this moment when he says, I'm glad I'm with Karen. And then it cuts to her singing and dancing. She's the cutest person on the planet. She was so stinkin' cute.

JENNA FISCHER [01:17:35] Yes. And I think Rashida would be happy to know that Ariana November wrote in to say, "Is Rashida Jones a trained singer? Because she is really good".

ANGELA KINSEY [01:17:44] Aw.

JENNA FISCHER [01:17:45] And I thought she had a great voice, too.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:17:48] I did, too. And then I even thought, you know, Jim's reaction, like waving his phone in the air. It was cute.

JENNA FISCHER [01:17:54] Yeah. So then Phyllis tosses her bouquet and Ryan swats it away from Kelly. Kelly was clearly going to catch that bouquet and Ryan swats it away. A lot of people wanted to know if that was a scripted moment. Yes. Yes, it was.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:18:13] Yeah. Ryan can't let Kelly catch that. Do you know what that would do for their relationship? No, no, no. But who does catch it? Toby's date and I loved so much, Jenna, that one-on-one of Toby to camera where he's like, "Toby. Yeah"!

JENNA FISCHER [01:18:26] Yeah. Well, now we move outside and Michael is sitting on a bench with Uncle Al and they're having this big heart to heart.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:18:35] How perfect is that?

JENNA FISCHER [01:18:39] It was such a great scene. We had some people write in. Christy, Carol, Connor Yates and Ashley Howell all asked, "Can you talk about the actors that played Uncle Al and Phyllis' dad, Elbert, because they were both fabulous"? Well, guys, George Ives played Uncle Al. And he was a longtime television actor. He appeared in "Mr. Ed", "The Andy Griffith Show, "My Three Sons", "Bewitched" and a bunch of movies. He passed away in 2013 and "The Office" was his last television show that he appeared in, according to IMDB. Yeah. And he was just absolutely fabulous.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:19:22] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [01:19:23] And then Hansford Rowe played Phyllis' father. He passed away in 2017. He was a very accomplished actor. Listen to the movies he's been in. He was in "Dante's Peak", "Baby Boom", "Three Days of the Condor". He's been in a ton of television shows. "Modern Family", "Will and Grace", "Curb Your Enthusiasm", "Six Feet Under". But here's the one that got me. He was in this mini series called "V". Do you remember "V"?

ANGELA KINSEY [01:19:56] Was is about aliens taking over?

JENNA FISCHER [01:20:00] Yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:20:00] And then-.

JENNA FISCHER [01:20:00] It was from the 80s.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:20:01] Yeah, people would do the sign, the V. The sign with fingers.

JENNA FISCHER [01:20:05] Yes. And the way you found out they were aliens is they would peel off their skin and they were like lizard people underneath.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:20:14] Yeah. Oh, my God, I forgot about that show.

JENNA FISCHER [01:20:17] Remember how shocking it was when you saw their lizard skin?

ANGELA KINSEY [01:20:19] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [01:20:20] Well, listen, we had a fan question from Sierra, Katie Reagen, Katie Slemp, Allison and Lexi. They all noticed that at 19 minutes, 30 seconds, as Phyllis is leaving the church, she seems to have a black brace on her right knee. Well, guys, I asked Phyllis about this, and she does not remember, she was definitely not injured during the making of this episode. But, you know, she said she went through a few injuries during her time on the show. And I guess this must have been when she was favoring that knee a little bit. But I stopped it. And sure enough, there is a little bit of a bandage there.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:20:59] I did not catch that.

JENNA FISCHER [01:21:01] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:21:01]  Oh, man. We have really good background catchers that watch the show.

JENNA FISCHER [01:21:05] We do.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:21:06] Well, now we have this tag, this little scene at the end, and it's Bob and Phyllis they're, they're doing that thing where you shove the wedding cake in the face kind of thing. And of course, Michael wants to get in on it. It's really awkward. I don't know if you noticed on this cake. It was so amazing. It was so well done. There was a full silver refrigerator made of fondant that sat on top of the cake as like the topper, next to the bride and groom figurine.

JENNA FISCHER [01:21:33] I did not notice that.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:21:34] Yes.

JENNA FISCHER [01:21:34] That is brilliant, of course. Of course, there was a Vance refrigerator on the top of the cake with them.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:21:41] That was also cake. So you know how, you know how you take the top part of the cake and you save it and you have it on your one year anniversary. They're gonna eat that refrigerator on their one year anniversary.

JENNA FISCHER [01:21:55] Did you do that? Did you save the top of your cake and eat it a year later?

ANGELA KINSEY [01:21:58] No. Did you?

JENNA FISCHER [01:22:00] Oh, no.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:22:00] Do you?

JENNA FISCHER [01:22:01] You know what? It's weird. I can't remember. But this past year, we just celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary. Lee and I. 10 years this year.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:22:10] That's amazing, lady.

JENNA FISCHER [01:22:12] Well, it happened during a pandemic. And we had these plans that for our 10th wedding anniversary, we wanted to take a big trip and take the kids to the spot where Lee proposed to me. And I wanted to have a family portrait taken in this spot. And that was, I mean, I've been, had this in my head for like-.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:22:33] Years.

JENNA FISCHER [01:22:33] Since our seventh wedding anniversary.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:22:35] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [01:22:35] Yes. That this would be such a fun way to mark our 10th wedding anniversary. Well, you know, then we couldn't really go anywhere because our, our anniversary's in July. So we ended up having dinner outside underneath our fruit trees and our original wedding planner, Beth Helmesstutter. You know her.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:22:54] Yes.

JENNA FISCHER [01:22:54] She set it all up for us. She came over, she wore a mask. She set this little table out under our trees. And do you know what she did for us?

ANGELA KINSEY [01:23:03] What?

JENNA FISCHER [01:23:04] She had the records from our wedding. And she had a tiny replica of our wedding cake made for us, for four peoples, so that our kids could eat our wedding cake on our 10th wedding anniversary.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:23:17] Stop it. That is so special. That is so sweet. I wanted to tell you, though, we didn't eat the top of our cake. That wasn't the type of cake we had at our wedding. But I have to tell you, our topper story, which is, you know, we're a blended family. We were two whole families coming together. So our children were a really big part of our wedding. They all wanted to speak at the ceremony. And then when it came time for the cake, instead of getting a traditional bride and groom figurine, we let the kids design this out of Legos.

JENNA FISCHER [01:23:50] Oh, that's right.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:23:51] And so we had a little Lego, sort of like they made like a little archway out of Legos. And then they put little Lego flowers on the white archway. And then they made Legos of me and Josh. And then of each of them. So all three kids. So we had five little Legos under a Lego archway on top of our wedding cake.

JENNA FISCHER [01:24:12] So sweet.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:24:12] So cute. Right? And we saved it. It's on our mantle.

JENNA FISCHER [01:24:15] Well, lady, I just love all that. So we did get some questions about this cake scene. And guys, I want to let you know. So this was originally shot to be earlier in the episode, and then they just liked it, so they used it as the tag. But it was meant to go right before Dwight confronts Uncle Al for stealing the bread at the buffet and throws him out.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:24:37] OK.

JENNA FISCHER [01:24:37] There were some questions about why this was at the end of the episode. It. It was just, sometimes we do that. Sometimes, you know, we cut back to a moment that might have happened earlier as our tag.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:24:47] That's the fun thing about a cold open and a tag. Sometimes they don't have to be in sort of a time ordered manner.

JENNA FISCHER [01:24:54] Yes. Yes. Well, the original tag of this episode was supposed to be a series of photos where Michael is photobombing every single picture. I remember taking these pictures and you can find some of them.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:25:09] You can. Where are they? Office Tally, maybe.

JENNA FISCHER [01:25:12] Yeah. So for a while NBC had these photos up on their website, and I don't think they're there anymore. But I'm going to do a little digging. And if we can find them, we'll put them up on the pod. But I remember shooting them. It was very, very fun.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:25:25] Yeah, I remember those too. Well, you know, Jenna, we asked Phyllis about the cake and just about this episode, things she remembered and, and things that stood out to her. And here's what she had to say.

PHYLLIS SMITH [01:25:36] Yes, it was very good cake. And we didn't really do that many takes of it. It was the end of the night. They didn't want to mess my face and hair up every time. So I think we just practiced it without messing it all of our faces. And then we did it just the one time. So, no, we didn't, we didn't do that multiple times where it had to be cleaned up and this and that. And then Michael went crazy, of course, smearing it all over his face. And, you know, one of the funniest scenes that I think in the whole, that tore me up when I saw it for the first time was when Michael was outside jumping at the window, trying to look in after he had been escorted out by Dwight. I don't know, for some reason that just really tore me up. I thought that whole wedding was, was, of course I would, was a remarkable episode. Everybody had their, their shining moments in it. Kelly dressed in white and the whole Pam and Jim, Karen, Roy triangle. That was all great. It was just pretty special. And Ken, I think Ken directed that. He was fantastic. I always enjoyed working with him and we were so blessed on that show. We had so many great writers, directors, and the fact that we all got to grow up together on this show, basically, not just this episode, the whole nine seasons. And it was really a blessing then and continues to be to this day. I'm glad you enjoyed the episode. I'm assuming you did. And I'll talk to you later.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:27:22] Well, now we're wrapping up the episode. But Jenna, before we say goodbye, I have to talk about a few deleted scenes. One I talked about with Ken Whittingham, about Angela's whole runner with Dennis.

JENNA FISCHER [01:27:33] Yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:27:34] Dennis the veterinarian. Who-.

JENNA FISCHER [01:27:37] Yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:27:37] She says, I'm sorry, but I'm with someone. She does end up turning Dennis down. But here are the two other deleted scenes that were so funny to me. Number one, Kevin has a talking head. He says that he has proposed to four different girls.

JENNA FISCHER [01:27:55] Oh, my gosh.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:27:56] Four. But Stacy was the first one to say yes. And, you know, if it couldn't be Melissa Riley, then he's glad it was Stacy.

JENNA FISCHER [01:28:05] Wow.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:28:05] Who the heck is Melissa Riley?

JENNA FISCHER [01:28:08] I don't know.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:28:09] OK. I thought that was delicious. And this is the other one. I loved "Wedding planners. Listen up". There is a deleted scene where Meredith holds up a party favor and it's a little tiny refrigerator magnet. And when you open the door to the refrigerator, there's a picture of Phyllis and Bob.

JENNA FISCHER [01:28:30] Wow.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:28:31] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [01:28:32] Well, she didn't steal that from Pam's wedding.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:28:34] She didn't steal that one. But don't you wish you had that magnet, that little refrigerator magnet?

JENNA FISCHER [01:28:40] So in the deleted scene, we see this item?

ANGELA KINSEY [01:28:44] Yes. I took a screen grab of it. So-.

JENNA FISCHER [01:28:46] Who has that now?

ANGELA KINSEY [01:28:48] I don't know. But Meredith is the one who holds it up. She's like, did you guys get your little magnet? And it's a refrigerator. It's so cute.

JENNA FISCHER [01:28:57] Angela, I love this refrigerator magnet that goes on your refrigerator so much that I would like you, please, because you're in charge of our merch.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:29:06] I am. I love it. You guys, if you ever have ideas, let me know.

JENNA FISCHER [01:29:10] Well, I have one. So I'm letting you know, will you please make a refrigerator magnet with a little door that opens? And inside their refrigerator is me and you. I don't know why we're in the refrigerator. I just want to be in there. OK?

ANGELA KINSEY [01:29:25] OK.

JENNA FISCHER [01:29:26] I can be holding a little jar of sour dough starter and you can be holding something too.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:29:31] A glass of wine.

JENNA FISCHER [01:29:33] Sure.
