OFFICE LADIES | EPISODE 73 - JOB FAIR

[00:00:04] Jenna I'm Jenna Fischer.



[00:00:05] Angela And I'm Angela Kinsey.



[00:00:06] Jenna We were on The Office together.



[00:00:07] Angela And we're best friends.



[00:00:08] Jenna And now we're doing the ultimate Office rewatch podcast just for you.



[00:00:12] Angela Each week we will break down an episode of The Office and give exclusive behind the scenes stories that only two people who were there can tell you.



[00:00:19] Jenna We're the Office Ladies.



[00:00:24] Jenna Hi, lady, and everyone.



[00:00:26] Angela Hi, everyone out there, I'm so happy you're here listening. Jenna and I, someday we're going to come out there and take it on the road, meet you.



[00:00:34] Jenna Whoa. That's news to me. I guess we're doing it, though, because if Angela gets an idea, it's going to happen.



[00:00:42] Angela I think we got to do one in Scranton, Jenna.



[00:00:44] Jenna Oh, well, that's a given.



[00:00:46] Angela We got to go to Scranton. We got to do an Office Ladies from Scranton.



[00:00:50] Jenna All right. It's been said now. It must be done.



[00:00:53] Angela Lady, tell them what we're talking about today.



[00:00:56] Jenna Today is Season four, Episode 17, Job Fair. This was written by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky, Writers of Dinner Party and directed by Tucker Gates. Would you like a summary?



[00:01:10] Angela I can't wait for your summaries. Like Wednesday night, because we record on Thursday, I go to bed and I'm like, what is Jenna's summary going to be?



[00:01:17] Jenna I know you do. I know you try to text me and get me to tell you my summaries ahead of time and I say, you're just going to have to wait for it.



[00:01:24] Angela Yeah. You want to surprise me. I go to bed thinking about it. I wake up thinking about it.



[00:01:28] Jenna Well, here it is. Wait no longer.



[00:01:30] Angela OK.



[00:01:30] Jenna Michael, Pam, Oscar and Darryl attend a job fair at Pam's alma mater, Valley View High School, in search of the, quote, best and brightest potential summer interns. Jim is on probation at Dunder Mifflin. He got his warning from Ryan. So he is going to attempt to redeem himself by working a potential client over golf with the help of Andy and Kevin. The rest of the Dunder Mifflin employees take the day off despite a warning from Dwight, except for Angela, who ends her silent treatment of him when they find themselves alone in the office.



[00:02:10] Angela It's perfect. That's a perfect summary.



[00:02:13] Jenna Thank you.



[00:02:14] Angela You're welcome.



[00:02:15] Jenna Fastback number one. Valley View High School, Pam's alma mater.



[00:02:19] Angela Yeah.



[00:02:19] Jenna We got mail. Kavya R and Courtney K. asked Is Valley View High School a real high school and did you film there?



[00:02:28] Angela And...



[00:02:30] Jenna It is a real high school.



[00:02:31] Angela Ding, ding, ding.



[00:02:33] Jenna It's about nine miles north of Scranton in the suburb of Archbald. Their school mascot is the cougar.



[00:02:39] Angela Mm hmm.



[00:02:40] Jenna And their school colors appear to be blue and yellow, maybe blue and gold.



[00:02:45] Angela Goldish yellow. I went to the website because it's the cougar, right?



[00:02:49] Jenna So you're saying it's yellow?



[00:02:50] Angela I'm saying it's golden yellow. Goldish yellow.



[00:02:54] Jenna OK, their colors are blue and goldish yellow. OK, we did not film at that school. Oh, no. We filmed at Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, California. By the way, in my research, I discovered that the music videos for Gwen Stefani's Hollaback Girl, Eminem's No Love and Lil Wayne's Prom Queen have also all filmed at Birmingham High School.



[00:03:22] Angela Very, very popular location.



[00:03:25] Jenna Well, wait for it. Angela, do you know what else is filmed there?



[00:03:28] Angela Oh, God. Oh, let me guess. Let me guess. Fast Times at Ridgemont High.



[00:03:32] Jenna No.



[00:03:33] Angela Grease.



[00:03:34] Jenna It's an Office connection.



[00:03:36] Angela Oh. Hmm. 40 Year Old Virgin?



[00:03:40] Jenna An episode of Monk,



[00:03:45] Angela Oh!



[00:03:46] Jenna An episode of Monk. What is it with The Office and Monk?



[00:03:49] Angela I don't know. I really wish we had filmed back in like the fifties. Remember when they would do those crossover episodes and all of a sudden, like Laverne and Shirley would be over at, you know, the Fonzie's house?



[00:04:02] Jenna Yeah.



[00:04:02] Angela It'd be like Happy Days, Laverne and Shirley. What if we had a Monk The Office crossover?



[00:04:07] Jenna I wish we could go back in time and make that happen because we clearly used the same locations and the same guest stars.



[00:04:14] Angela Have Tony Shalhoub walk into the bullpen. Come on,



[00:04:17] Jenna And interview, someone maybe Toby, for being the Scranton Strangler.



[00:04:22] Angela Yes! We did it. We did it.



[00:04:24] Jenna There it is, everybody. Your Office reunion is also a Monk crossover. Done. A little more information on the school. The school colors for Birmingham High School appear to be blue and white. Kent Zbornak told me that we had to create all of our own signage and props for the school because we had to make sure, per our agreement with Birmingham High School, that none of their actual logos or artwork or signage was seen. So there you go. We made it all, everything hanging on the wall, everything.



[00:05:01] Angela Wowsers, it's a lot.



[00:05:03] Jenna Listen, when Kent told me that as I was watching the episode, I was like, that's a lot of signs.



[00:05:07] Angela Yeah.



[00:05:08] Jenna Check it out.



[00:05:09] Angela Our department was very busy this episode.



[00:05:11] Jenna They were. I'm moving us into fast fact number two, it's called golfing.



[00:05:16] Angela Wait, wait. I sense a location breakdown.



[00:05:19] Jenna You are correct, Angela. And it's because we got a fan question from Sophia D. Where did you film the scenes at the golf course? Because I'll have you notice, I looked, we never see a sign for where our guys are supposed to be. I Googled there is a country club of Scranton that offers golf as well as a few other golf courses near the Scranton area. I don't know which course this is supposed to be, but we filmed at Vista Valencia Golf Course in Santa Clarita.



[00:05:47] Angela Mm hmm.



[00:05:48] Jenna It's a twenty seven hole facility. It has an 18 hole par sixty one course and a nine hole par three course. Now, here's what I found very interesting. Maybe only to me.



[00:06:00] Angela Let's hear it.



[00:06:01] Jenna The prices to play depend on what day you're playing and also what time you arrive. It's least expensive to go during the week, in the afternoon. If you come first thing in the morning, it's going to cost you twenty four fifty to walk the course or thirty six fifty to ride it. If you come at three o'clock, it's only thirteen dollars to walk it and twenty three fifty to ride it. But why is it more expensive to ride it? Is it because that comes with the cart? I couldn't find that information. It seems like you'd flow faster if you're ridin it than if you're walking it. Guess what everybody. I don't know a lot about golfing.



[00:06:37] Angela I don't. This is why I am quiet, because I'm like, I don't know.



[00:06:40] Jenna But here's the big kicker, and this is why I think you and I need to go to this golf course.



[00:06:44] Angela OK?



[00:06:45] Jenna They have something called foot golf.



[00:06:48] Angela Foot golf?



[00:06:49] Jenna I'd never heard of it. It's a real thing. It's a combination of soccer and golf



[00:06:55] Angela And hacky sack.



[00:06:56] Jenna I think you could hacky and sack it in there. There's basically a special golf course, but the holes are really big and you kick the ball down the course into the hole.



[00:07:05] Angela OK.



[00:07:06] Jenna Foot golf. Maybe we could frolf and then foot golf.



[00:07:10] Angela I would foot golf if there was like a pony keg set up on, like, the eighth hole. So, like, you kick your ball, then you have a beer, then you kick your ball.



[00:07:19] Jenna What's a pony keg?



[00:07:21] Angela A pony keg is that don't you have pony kegs. It's like a party key. It's like a mini keg of beer, a pony keg. Anyone? Sam? Cassi? Pony keg. Ever heard of it?



[00:07:31] Jenna A pony keg is a mini keg?



[00:07:33] Angela Yeah, it's like a baby keg.



[00:07:34] Sam No you're right. Pony keg is a quarter keg.



[00:07:37] Angela Yeah! Thank you.



[00:07:38] Jenna What's a half keg called?



[00:07:42] Angela Silence.



[00:07:47] Sam I don't find any cool names.



[00:07:48] Jenna Oh, so you can get a- here are your choices: pony keg, half keg, keg. I feel like they sell more pony kegs just because the name is cute, but I don't know.



[00:08:00] Angela And you can carry them if you're on the petite side like myself.



[00:08:04] Jenna Oh, we're learning so much today.



[00:08:06] Angela So much.



[00:08:07] Jenna Fast fact number three, Angela, you were very, very, very pregnant in this episode.



[00:08:13] Angela Yeah, I was



[00:08:17] Jenna When you were filming your scenes with Dwight in the office.



[00:08:20] Angela Mm hmm.



[00:08:21] Jenna Lee Eisenberg had the flu. He was not there that day. Only Gene Stupnitsky was on the set. When they got into the editing bay to edit the episode, Lee Eisenberg was there and he said, you guys, why don't we have any wider shots of these scenes? And Dave Rogers and Gene had to remind him, because Angela's belly was very hard to hide. So all these all of these shots are like Angela from like the shoulders up. But here is what else I found in my Googling, Angela.



[00:08:51] Angela What?



[00:08:52] Jenna By the time this episode aired, you had given birth.



[00:08:57] Angela I know.



[00:08:58] Jenna You gave birth five days before this episode aired.



[00:09:02] Angela That is true. Well, lady, I have a really fun story from this episode, and it's something that involves the golf course. I had no scenes at the golf course, but I went to visit the fellahs. I was doing a whole series at this time on NBC Dotcom called Adventures with Angela, and Creed and Ed had written a song for my baby. I mean, with the banjo, the guitar, the whole thing. So I went to the golf course on Monday on their lunch, and we sat out in this beautiful green like grassy area and they sang to me. And not only that, I couldn't remember how we got there. I was like, I don't remember driving to this place or where it was. And, you know, when you're a passenger, how you don't really pay attention as much?



[00:09:48] Jenna Yeah.



[00:09:49] Angela So I found this email that I had written to John Krasinski, where I said, Hey, John, I'll see you Monday. I can't wait. Creed is picking me up in his sports car. Should I be scared? And we're going to come and have lunch and he and Ed are going to sing a song for my little baby.



[00:10:07] Jenna Aww. So you rode in Creed's sports car?



[00:10:10] Angela I rode in Creed's little two seater sports car and they sang the song to me and it was on NBC Dotcom and Jenna they gave me a copy and I tore my house up looking for this this week. I have ransacked the whole house. I know I have it somewhere and I really wanted to play it for you guys. But Joya, who worked with us over at NBC Dotcom is on the case. She's gonna find it. And hopefully, maybe in a revisited, I'll be able to play it for you guys because it's really special and I'm just heartbroken that I couldn't find it.



[00:10:42] Jenna That is so cool, Angela. I remember seeing the video of that, so I really do hope you find it.



[00:10:49] Angela Me too. Me too. It was so cute. I remember Crede started off with Angela's baby. It was just so fun.



[00:10:57] Jenna Well, Ange, that's really all I had for this. I guess I have something that could be considered half a fast fact that I could throw in there.



[00:11:04] Angela Half a fast fact. What you got?



[00:11:07] Jenna My half a fast fact is that Toby was not in this episode because he was busy writing the season finale.



[00:11:13] Angela Oh, that is a good one. Well, I have a little Kinsey tidbit. Guess who found her script of Job Fair? This lady!



[00:11:22] Jenna Oh, my gosh, Angela, this is very exciting to me because I have a couple of fan questions that I didn't know the answer to, but I bet the answers are in the script.



[00:11:29] Angela Oh, let me get it. I'll get it. And let's go to break and we'll come back and jump into some Job Fair.



[00:11:35] Jenna I like it.



[00:11:39] Angela All right, we are back, I have my script of Job Fair and Jenna right out of the gate. I have a question for you.



[00:11:46] Jenna What is it?



[00:11:47] Angela Did you notice that this episode does not have a cold open?



[00:11:51] Jenna I kind of did. Angela, we have a scene before the credits, but it's on plot. It's on story. It's not one of those standalone comedic cold opens that we're used to. I did notice.



[00:12:03] Angela That's right. We just kind of get right into the meat of the episode, right?



[00:12:06] Jenna Yes.



[00:12:07] Angela There was a cold open and I'm going to read you a little bit about what it was, OK?



[00:12:11] Jenna OK.



[00:12:12] Angela So in the cold open, you hear this screaming noise from the men's restroom and everyone in the bullpen kind of grumbles like, oh, not again. And Michael comes out. He's just exasperated because he has dropped everything that was in his pockets into the toilet. Like everything. He listed off, he dropped his cell phone, his tip calculator, his wallet, his white strips, candy corn, his eraser. And then Jim says, what about your car keys? And Michael says, I threw them into the toilet out of anger. And this leads him to this light bulb moment, because I guess this happens quite frequently for Michael. And he goes into his office and he comes out and he's like, guys, I have invented this amazing invention. And he says it's the mesh toilet guard to go over the toilet. And then the camera pans past him and he is just cut out the back of his desk chair. That's mesh into like a circle. And he's like, who's going to volunteer? This is going to be great. It's lightweight, portable, reusable. You could just put it in your dishwasher. So what, he's going to start using the bathroom through this meshy cover, but he's thrilled. He thinks he's going to be a gazillionaire with the mesh toilet guard.



[00:13:22] Jenna I don't know where to begin.



[00:13:24] Angela I know. So that was the cold open that they didn't end up using and they just jumped right into the episode.



[00:13:30] Jenna Here's the thing. I can't remember if we shot that, but I remember that joke probably from the table read because we must have read it.



[00:13:38] Angela Yeah.



[00:13:39] Jenna I remember the joke that Michael threw his keys in out of anger.



[00:13:44] Angela That was my favorite part.



[00:13:45] Jenna So this isn't in the deleted scenes then?



[00:13:47] Angela It's not in the deleted scenes, but it is in the script. But they didn't use it.



[00:13:52] Jenna Hmm.



[00:13:53] Angela Just a little trivia for you, since I have the script,



[00:13:56] Jenna The script is paying off already. I'm excited about it. The way this episode does start is Michael comes out of his office. He's dressed in his jeans.



[00:14:07] Angela Yeah. He's got sneakers on. He's trying to look young and hip.



[00:14:11] Jenna I think so. Pam and Oscar and Darryl are all around reception. And we find out that today the four of them will be attending the job fair at Valley View High School in search of new interns because he wants to euthanize the office.



[00:14:27] Angela Well, there is a deleted scene where Michael shares that he's been really depressed since Ryan left. Sam, can you play that?



[00:14:36] Michael Scott I am depressed. Ever since Ryan left, I've been going through empty nest syndrome, and I call it that because that's the way I felt when Empty Nest went off the air. I am. Lonely. And I need a new Ryan.



[00:14:55] Jenna That's amazing.



[00:14:56] Angela Yeah, and so he sees this job fair at the local high school as his way to recruit some young buddy. Michael, just wants a younger sibling.



[00:15:05] Jenna Yeah, we had a fan question from Thomas V, how did they decide who got to go to the job fair? This was one of those instances where they would look at the cast and they would say, who haven't we seen together yet or in a while? And that's kind of how they pulled the names, because something I noticed is that there is not technically a sales person represented.



[00:15:30] Angela Mm hmm.



[00:15:31] Jenna So there's someone from accounting. There's someone from the warehouse, front reception who Michael refers to as the eye candy, and Michael, who I guess could also cover sales.



[00:15:43] Angela Right. He was a really good salesman.



[00:15:44] Jenna He was.



[00:15:45] Angela Yeah.



[00:15:46] Jenna But yeah, this was more about pairing of people and characters and who would make a great foil for Michael at the job fair.



[00:15:54] Angela Well, we know why I couldn't go.



[00:15:56] Jenna Yeah.



[00:15:57] Angela You would have just to shoot four floating heads. It would have just been four heads in a high school auditorium because I was super pregs. OK, so that's who went to the high school. But now we have this other kind of odd pairing headed to the golf course. It's Jim, Andy and Kevin. And Jim's on probation. He's got to make this big, big sale. And this is his rag tag team that I guess is going to help him.



[00:16:21] Jenna Yeah, things start off a little, how would you put it? Oddly, because the first thing that Andy does is insult Mr. McGuire, their potential client, because he's wearing a Dartmouth sweatshirt.



[00:16:34] Angela He tells him to take it off and that his grandfather would be spinning in his urn if he knew he was golfing with a Dartmouth alum. There's clearly some real rivalry here between Cornell and Dartmouth



[00:16:45] Jenna Well I looked it up.



[00:16:46] Angela Mm hmm.



[00:16:47] Jenna It's this big college football rivalry between the Cornell Big Red and the Dartmouth Big Green. I guess these two schools were major football powers back in the day. There has since been a split in the divisions, the football divisions. But prior to the split, Cornell kind of dominated the national championships. They won in nineteen fifteen, nineteen twenty one, twenty two, twenty three and thirty nine. Dartmouth won once in nineteen twenty five.



[00:17:18] Angela So Cornell was dominating the Ivy League.



[00:17:20] Jenna Yes. But then in nineteen forty there was this infamous game, Ange.



[00:17:25] Angela Oh.



[00:17:27] Jenna Cornell had a sixteen game winning streak and this was like a school record. They were about to win the national championship with a score of seven to three. But guess what they did?



[00:17:37] Angela What?



[00:17:38] Jenna They did a film review of the game and found out that Cornell had inadvertently used five downs instead of four and they had to forfeit the game to Dartmouth.



[00:17:50] Angela Oh!



[00:17:51] Jenna According to the ESPN College Football Encyclopedia, they consider this to be the second greatest moment in college football history, and it is commonly referred to as the fifth down game. So I guess that's why Andy's grandfather was spinning in his urn.



[00:18:10] Angela Well, Mindy went to Dartmouth, so she might have known some of that rivalry. I have to think that might have come up in the writers room.



[00:18:17] Jenna I wonder.



[00:18:17] Angela And there are deleted scenes that support this. Jim shares that, you know what? He's bringing Andy on purpose because he knew Andy would flip out about Mr. Maguire being a Dartmouth guy, and then they would have sort of this like common enemy, that it would be bonding for Mr. McGuire and Jim because Andy's an idiot.



[00:18:39] Jenna Well, that doesn't track because Jim seems so horrified by Andy's comment to Mr. McGuire.



[00:18:46] Angela Exactly. So then there's the scene where Mr. McGuire is like, gosh, this guy. And Jim's like I know, Cornell, right?



[00:18:53] Jenna Oh, I get it.



[00:18:54] Angela Oh, yeah. Jim was being diabolical. He had a whole plan.



[00:18:59] Jenna Right. Best friends through a common enemy.



[00:19:03] Angela That's right. Look at us. We're buddies now. We're pals. Give me your business. Don't pay attention to that Cornell idiot. Thank God you have me here.



[00:19:10] Jenna Yeah. Don't pay attention to that idiot who also works at my company. I don't know if this was a great plan, Jim.



[00:19:16] Angela Well, it's part of his strategy.



[00:19:19] Jenna Andy also can't shake hands with Mr. McGuire because his hands are covered in blisters.



[00:19:24] Angela Blisties.



[00:19:25] Jenna Yeah.



[00:19:26] Angela He's nifty gifties. He's blisties. He loves a little ies on things.



[00:19:31] Jenna I got the lowdown on how they made those blisters.



[00:19:34] Angela Oh, let's hear it. Who did it?



[00:19:36] Jenna It was our makeup artist, Laverne. She applied the makeup. It took her about twenty or thirty minutes to do it. She started by putting coloring on his hand, so she kind of painted his hands red. Then she covered it with something called R.C.M.A scar making material. She said it's really, really tricky to apply because as soon as it dries, it's set, you can't move it and it dries really, really fast. So she would put it on really quickly with a tiny metal spatula and tweezers and that afterwards Ed was not allowed to wash his hands or get them wet.



[00:20:08] Angela How'd he go to the bathroom?



[00:20:11] Jenna I mean, I guess he just didn't wash his hands after. I hope he didn't-.



[00:20:18] Angela Awkward.



[00:20:20] Jenna Get them wet in any other way. Do you always wash your hands after you go to the bathroom?



[00:20:26] Angela Yes.



[00:20:27] Jenna Even at home?



[00:20:28] Angela Yes.



[00:20:30] Jenna After you pee at home, you wash your hands with soap and water every time.



[00:20:34] Angela Every time, every time I rinse 'em and I have a little pump pump.



[00:20:37] Jenna Hmm.



[00:20:38] Angela Or I have a big bar and I rub my hand over the bar of soap. Every time. It was drilled into me by my mom.



[00:20:46] Jenna Hmm.



[00:20:46] Angela I rinse my hands every time. And I make Isabel, so it's just like automatic.



[00:20:53] Jenna I feel like it's really clear now that I don't always wash my hands after I pee at home. I feel like maybe we were going to bond over something that now we're not bonding over. Oh no.



[00:21:07] Angela And now I just think you're disgusting.



[00:21:09] Jenna I guess now you're going to have to worry when you come over to my house. Did I wash my hands after I pee? I always wash my hands after poop. Always. I never wipe a poop and then not wash my hands, everybody. I feel like I want that to be clear.



[00:21:22] Angela Well good. Well I'm not going to worry. I'm just not going to touch your hands or anything your hands touch.



[00:21:28] Jenna I don't know how I feel about this conversation.



[00:21:31] Angela We should probably segue out of it.



[00:21:35] Jenna Well, I'll say this about blisters,



[00:21:37] Angela OK?



[00:21:38] Jenna It might fall under the heading of things you already know. But as the emerging amateur medical expert of Office Ladies, you should never pop a blister.



[00:21:49] Angela Oh.



[00:21:50] Jenna The fluid inside your blister has healing properties and it also protects the affected area so that you won't get an infection. So you really want the fluid to stay in there as long as possible and just let the blister heal itself. Don't pop it.



[00:22:06] Angela I did not know that. I feel like I have popped many a blister.



[00:22:10] Jenna This is so interesting.



[00:22:12] Angela I'm not going to pop a blister now. I'm just going to look at it and say Jenna told me to let it do its thing, so I'ma let it do its thing.



[00:22:18] Jenna I might start washing my hands after I pee at home.



[00:22:21] Angela I hope so.



[00:22:24] Jenna Well, now Mr. McGuire wants to make this golf game more interesting. So he suggests that they make a little wager. Why don't they do a little betting?



[00:22:33] Angela Oh, my gosh. This is music to Kevin's ears. Kevin's like what? Mr. McGuire suggests ten dollars a hole. But Kevin. Jenna, he lists all of these games.



[00:22:43] Jenna I know. I wrote them down. You want to hear what they are?



[00:22:46] Angela I do.



[00:22:47] Jenna All right. He says you want to play skins, acey deucey, Bingo bango Bongo, Sandies's, Barkies, Wolf.



[00:22:54] Angela Arnies. Don't forget Arnies.



[00:22:56] Jenna Oh I'm so sorry I forgot Arnies. I looked it up. These are all real ways to bet on golf. They're real. I mean I have an explanation for all of them. I won't go into it but fascinating. I didn't even realize you could do this much golf betting.



[00:23:12] Angela Clearly there's so much golf gambling and you know what it tracks that Kevin would know.



[00:23:16] Jenna Yeah, this is bringing up his whole gambling thing.



[00:23:20] Angela And he admits that he's going to take the petty cash from Oscar and use it to turn it into next month's rent. So he is gambling with Dunder Mifflin's petty cash.



[00:23:29] Jenna Should we move on to this job, fair lady?



[00:23:32] Angela Yes. Let's move on to the job fair. Pam has to walk down memory lane and for high school and you learn a lot about her.



[00:23:39] Jenna Yeah, she has this talking head where she says this gym reminds her of all the times she pretended to have PMS to get out of playing sports,



[00:23:48] Angela in particular volleyball. But yet in Company Picnic she's like a volleyball pro. So what's happening?



[00:23:54] Jenna Oh, have we ever gotten more mail?



[00:23:58] Angela I feel seen. Thank you for everyone that wrote in. As soon as Pam said that, I was like, what the heck?



[00:24:04] Jenna  I know. Chelsea B wrote in this theory on why it still tracks that she would have pretended to have PMS while also being a volleyball champion. And I loved it. So here is Chelsea's theory. She says People always point out the continuity error that Pam says she faked cramps so she wouldn't have to play volleyball in gym class. However, maybe Pam faked cramps because she didn't want to have to play volleyball with her classmates who weren't very good at it. As a former athlete myself, I can tell you I wouldn't have had much fun playing my sport with people who sucked at it. So in my opinion, it's not surprising that she tried to get out of it.



[00:24:45] Angela Well, Chelsea, I think you're being very kind.



[00:24:48] Jenna What? I love that Chelsea is like, Pam is such a bad ass volleyball player that she cannot handle a gym class volleyball game.



[00:24:59] Angela I mean, come on in high school, like, they would have pulled you out, put you in varsity volleyball, you would have been separated from the lame-os.



[00:25:07] Jenna No, this was gym class. This was just like everybody get exercise in gym class. We're going to play volleyball today. So Pam was probably on the varsity team, but she just didn't want to have to play in gym class. It was a waste of her time and talent.



[00:25:22] Angela OK, Chelsea. OK, ok. OK.



[00:25:27] Jenna Well, I'm living for your piece of mail. Chelsea. I appreciated it.



[00:25:30] Angela You made her day Chelsea. Well, there's another deleted scene with Pam as she's going through the high school. She walks past the sports trophy case and there is a big old photo of Roy Anderson, the big jock, you know, in high school. And she looks at it and says, nine years of my life.



[00:25:48] Jenna I remember shooting that.



[00:25:49] Angela Mm hmm.



[00:25:50] Jenna They had done this little Photoshop of David Denman.



[00:25:54] Angela Yeah. In a high school photo. And Oscar has a deleted talking head where he says, No. Surprisingly enough, I did not always dream of being an accountant at Dunder Mifflin. In high school I was just a normal kid. I made decent grades, played bass in a new wave band, had a poster of Kim Basinger over my bed. Oh, how I wanted to be Kim Basinger.



[00:26:17] Jenna That is a great talking head.



[00:26:19] Angela It was. I wish it had stayed in.



[00:26:22] Jenna Michael is feeling pretty confident about his booth. So much so that the only thing that he brought was a blank piece of paper, so it's the four of them sitting at a table with a blank piece of paper in front of them.



[00:26:35] Angela Well, he says a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities. It's conceptual. It's what he says. Meanwhile, the booth next door has like a basketball hoop and then one has like a popcorn machine. No one is going to stop by this booth. And there's a deleted scene Jenna that goes on for so long- I loved it so much- of just a steady stream of kids walking past you guys not stopping at all. And the only one that stops briefly sits down is popcorn like container and just leaves it there like trash. It spills over. And then Oscar is just tidying up this kid's trash.



[00:27:14] Jenna Angela, we had so much fun shooting these scenes. I so loved getting to be on location with these three guys. We had the best time. They gave all the background actors the direction that they should be, like having a great time and smiling and high energy at all the other booths so that when you got to ours, it was particularly quiet and sad looking.



[00:27:36] Angela It really, really works. It was cracking me up.



[00:27:39] Jenna Should we go back over to Dunder Mifflin and see what everyone else is up to?



[00:27:43] Angela Yes. Well, let me tell you what they're up to. They're up to trying to sneak out of work. I mean, Meredith and Phyllis are stirring the pot. Michael is gone. They don't want to stay the whole day.



[00:27:53] Jenna No.



[00:27:53] Angela And Creed has a great line where he says he finished his work months ago.



[00:27:58] Jenna I loved that.



[00:27:59] Angela Like, what is he doing? Dwight reminds them all that when Michael is gone, Jim is in charge. And when Jim is gone, Andy and Dwight are in charge. And when Andy is gone, you answer to Dwight. And Stanley's like, I don't give a crap, I'm out.



[00:28:13] Jenna I love so much that moment when Stanley walks out the door,



[00:28:17] Angela I did, too. And Dwight doesn't know what to do. You know, we have said we feel like Stanley is the person Dwight was like, I am not going to, like, mess with Stanley. But Dwight asserts to the whole office, Look, you guys, the American workday ends at five o'clock.



[00:28:32] Jenna And so you must stay until the end of the workday, period.



[00:28:36] Angela Or all tattle on you.



[00:28:37] Jenna Right.



[00:28:39] Back at the high school, Pam is chatting up a young prospective intern. He's actually interested in Dunder Mifflin and Michael signals her to stop.



[00:28:51] Jenna Yeah, well, not just that. He goes up to this kid whose name is Justin. He says, I don't think this is the job for you. Paper should be more of a hobby for you. And then he takes away the kid's pamphlet that he was looking at.



[00:29:04] Angela Yeah.



[00:29:05] Jenna We had a fan catch about it, though, from Harmjun V and Alissa C. If Michael only brought one sheet of paper to the job fair, where did the brochure come from that Pam gave to Justin and Michael took away?



[00:29:19] Angela Mm hmm.



[00:29:20] Jenna Good question.



[00:29:21] Angela I mean, clearly, they brought a brochure. I felt like the paper was their prop, was the thing that was supposed to be the eye catching moment as people walked by.



[00:29:30] Jenna So maybe under the desk, Pam had some additional materials.



[00:29:33] Angela When the paper makes you stop in your tracks to talk to these people at their booth, then you get a pamphlet.



[00:29:40] Jenna OK, I like it. Michael is furious that Justin signed his name on their blank piece of paper. He's even more furious to learn that Pam only brought the one.



[00:29:52] Angela Yeah, and Pam's like, excuse me? I love that she totally calls him out on it.



[00:29:57] Jenna I know. She said, Michael, do you not remember? I said, are you sure that we only need one sheet of paper? And you said, yeah, we only need one sheet of paper to make a difference. And then you sneezed in my tea and said, don't worry, it's just allergies.



[00:30:14] Angela Pam, with the receipts. That's what the kids say, Jenna.



[00:30:17] Jenna Oh, I like it. We had a fan question from Kate B. When Justin signed his name on the piece of paper he writes, Justin E. But later in the episode, he tells Michael that his last name is Paulsnick. Explain. I'll tell you.



[00:30:33] Angela I am intrigued.



[00:30:35] Jenna The actor who plays Justin, his name is Trevor Einhorn.



[00:30:40] Angela Oh. So maybe he was writing his actual last name.



[00:30:43] Jenna Yes. Isn't that amazing?



[00:30:45] Angela Mm hmm.



[00:30:46] Jenna So Trevor Einhorn has been a professional actor since he was five years old and his breakout role was on the television comedy Frazier. He played Frederick Crane, the son of Frasier and Lilith.



[00:31:01] Angela Oh, my gosh.



[00:31:02] Jenna Yes. He also went on to have a recurring role on Mad Men. He was in season six and seven as a copywriter. And he also played Neil Kellerman in the ABC remake of Dirty Dancing. He currently stars as Josh Hoberman in the sci fi show The Magicians. He is a Scorpio. I'll have you know



[00:31:23] Angela That's new for I guest. I don't feel like you've shared their Zodiac sign before. Is this a new part of the guest star breakdown?



[00:31:29] Jenna Well, it showed up in his bio, so I thought I'd throw it in there.



[00:31:32] Angela OK.



[00:31:33] Jenna Finally, he is not related to our cinematographer, Randall Einhorn.



[00:31:38] Angela That is correct.



[00:31:39] Jenna Just a coincidence.



[00:31:41] Angela Everyone back in the bullpen still really wants to sneak out. They've waited for their moment. Dwight finally gets up and exits the bullpen to go to the bathroom and Creed calls Angela to tell her they're all leaving. The scene made me laugh so hard Jenna because this is a bit that Creed and I still do to this day. Creed will text me Pumpkin's out, or if we hang out, I'm like, all right, I'm going to go he'll say, Pumpkin's out. Like, he still says this to me after all of these years. And this just warmed my heart. I loved it so much. Sam, can you play the clip?



[00:32:20] Angela Martin Extension one two eight.



[00:32:21] Creed Hiya, pumpkin, it's Creed. So we're gonna ditch this bitch. You in?



[00:32:25] Angela Martin No.



[00:32:26] Creed Are you out? Pumpkin's out. Let's go gang.



[00:32:32] Jenna We got so much mail about this scene, Angela. People who listen to the podcast know that Creed calls you pumpkin in real life. And they wanted to know was Creed ad libbing in the scene and using his real life nickname for you or was Pumpkin in the script? And then he started calling you pumpkin after this.



[00:32:51] Angela This is exactly as it is in the script. Exactly. So Creed did not improvise that. But I will tell you, ever since we shot Job Fair, he has called me pumpkin to this day. He still calls me pumpkin.



[00:33:04] Jenna That is so cute.



[00:33:05] Angela I know. It's so cute. I loved that scene.



[00:33:12] Jenna Well, now Dwight comes out of the restroom and he sees that everyone has left. Everyone except Angela.



[00:33:19] Angela Mm hmm.



[00:33:19] Jenna Which makes total sense because she's the one other rule follower in this group.



[00:33:23] Angela Mm hmm. There is a great scene that's deleted where Dwight comes out and he goes, ha. Last man standing. And then Angela briskly walks past him and goes, excuse me. And then there's a talking head that Angela has that really explains why she is just as eager to be one of the last people in the office.



[00:33:44] Angela Martin Whenever I'm here by myself, I like to pretend that all the others are dead. So this is nice.



[00:33:53] Jenna Oh, my God, it made me laugh out loud. I spit out my water. I went to take a sip of water while we were listening to the deleted scene. It seemed like a safe time to take a sip of water, but that was so good.



[00:34:03] Angela She pretends that everyone is dead. And at the end they had me do a little smile like that I was very delighted by this.



[00:34:10] Jenna Oh, that is incredible. Well, Dwight's going to use this opportunity to call Michael and tattle. He is very, very mad. Michael is like, yeah, that makes total sense. Don't be weird. Everyone should go home. Why should they be there?



[00:34:24] Angela I'm not there. Jim's not there. Who cares, right?



[00:34:27] Jenna Oh, Dwight is so sad.



[00:34:30] Angela I know.



[00:34:31] Jenna But Dwight isn't going to go home. He has personal standards. He's going to work his day.



[00:34:36] Angela And he's going to dock everyone else's pay.



[00:34:39] Jenna He's going to try. Back at the job fair pam has gone into her old art room to get a sheet of paper.



[00:34:47] Angela I titled the scene Brutal. Pam just wants one moment of her glory days, right? One moment. She's going to show the camera her piece of art. Surely it's still on the wall.



[00:35:01] Jenna Yeah, we got a lot of mail about this. People wanted to know, what exactly is Pam looking for on the wall? Was it artwork? Was it an award? They wanted to know if there was more to this scene. And also just what was my take on this? I'll tell you, the idea was that when Pam was in school, a piece of her art was put on the wall on display. And it was a big moment for her that she was very proud of. And she very, very quickly, as soon as she says maybe it's still there, realizes that like a decade has gone by since this moment that she was so proud of, probably the last moment that her art was held up for admiration because, remember, her art show didn't go great.



[00:35:48] Angela Right.



[00:35:49] Jenna And so she just has this crushing, like you said, brutal realization that a lot of time has gone by since she invested in this part of herself. And she's quickly embarrassed and has to just stuff it down and walk away.



[00:36:04] Angela Well, it is exactly the same in the script as what you see in the episode.



[00:36:09] Jenna Yeah.



[00:36:10] Angela In the script it says Pam comes up to a room that is labeled Art Room and goes inside and walks confidently to the supply desk. She finds a blank piece of paper and shows it to the camera. Pam says, My old art room. Hey, I wonder if it's still here. She looks around at the walls that have some student artworks on them. Nope. They must have taken it down. Never mind.



[00:36:31] Jenna Yeah.



[00:36:31] Angela It's hard. It's hard to realize that you've put your hopes and dreams on hold.



[00:36:35] Jenna Yeah.



[00:36:36] Angela And she does in this moment.



[00:36:38] Jenna You know, after all that, Pam brings this piece of paper to Michael and it's wrong. He wanted Dunder Mifflin cardstock. He doesn't want this stupid random piece of paper. He sends her back to the office.



[00:36:50] Angela Yeah. He said, I don't want this Pendelton crap, which I looked up online and I couldn't find Pendelton paper. I did find Pendleton business cards. But he says, Pam, I want the ultra white card stock.



[00:37:03] Jenna Pam drives all the way back to Dunder Mifflin.



[00:37:06] Angela Yeah. And she goes and gets the ultra white card stock out of the copier. Dwight looks puzzled and rightly so, because I don't think that paper lives in the copier. Just going to say,



[00:37:18] Jenna Well, let me tell you something about copiers, Angela. She pulls it from a specialty drawer in the copier, not from the main paper feed of the copier, which could have held copy paper, perhaps in our special drawer you can select for when you want cardstock.



[00:37:36] Angela Well, I saw that she pulled it from the low drawer Jenna. I saw that and not the other drawer, but I just think it would be on the shelf so.



[00:37:46] Jenna Well, if it had been on the shelf it wouldn't have been as good of a shot between Dwight and Angela. So it had to come out of the copier. All right. That's the real reason.



[00:37:55] Angela OK, fine, fine.



[00:37:57] Jenna Well, we're about to go back to the golf course and there's a lot to talk about. I think maybe we should take a break and then we'll get into it. After we've refreshed ourselves and emptied our bladders. I will wash my hands.



[00:38:13] Angela If you need to know who Jenna is going to be at 70, you just heard her. After we have refreshed ourselves and emptied our bladders. All right, guys, we'll be right back. All right, we are back, Mr. McGuire is struggling with his ball.



[00:38:29] Jenna I like that.



[00:38:32] Angela He's struggling with his ball in the sandtrap. He can't get it out of the sand Jenna. And he doesn't want anyone to help him. He wants to do it himself. And listen, Andy is just such a hot mess. He's having all of his rage issues. He's got on his pants that have little pheasants on them.



[00:38:49] Jenna It's not going to make him happy when Jim gets a phone call from Pam while Andy's trying to swing.



[00:38:55] Angela No, it is not.



[00:38:56] Jenna And Jim is really trying to recruit Mr. McGuire. And McGuire is a big no. He's just like, no, no, no.



[00:39:04] Angela He just wants to play golf.



[00:39:05] Jenna Well, so does Andy, because he proposes that they race to the next hole. He hops in the golf cart and crashes it.



[00:39:13] Angela He goes flying. The roof of the golf cart is ripped off. This is a major golf cart crash. I mean, I feel like this was a big stunt for us.



[00:39:22] Jenna It was. We got a lot of mail about it. People wanted to know, did Ed do this stunt? No, no, no.



[00:39:29] Angela Course not. No, no, no.



[00:39:30] Jenna It was a stunt driver. We also got questions about everyone's actual golfing ability. Thomas V wants to know, did any of these guys actually play golf? Well,.



[00:39:43] Angela Well,



[00:39:45] Jenna Well.



[00:39:45] Angela Well, well.



[00:39:46] Jenna We will tell you,.



[00:39:47] Angela We know.



[00:39:48] Jenna I reached out to Ed and he said that before this episode he had never been a golfer and that the show gave everybody lessons so that they could look like they knew what they were doing. And he really, really enjoyed it. And he said since this episode, he has started playing recreationally. But he added, it's just for fun. Nothing like Brian Baumgartner.



[00:40:09] Angela Brian is an athlete. You guys, we have talked about this before. He's a heck of a golfer.



[00:40:15] Jenna Oh. Ange, he told me that his handicap is seven. That's really, really good, you guys.



[00:40:21] Angela It's really good. He plays on these big fancy golf tournaments. You guys, like Michael Jordan has a golf tournament and Brian plays in it.



[00:40:31] Jenna Brian won the Derek Jeter Celebrity Invitational one year.



[00:40:35] Angela Yeah. He goes to so many professional celebrity golf tournaments. He told me he has a room of suitcases because apparently there was a year where they gifted every golfer a suitcase.



[00:40:48] Jenna OK,.



[00:40:49] Angela He's like, I have so many suitcases if you ever need a suitcase.



[00:40:54] Jenna That's crazy. Well, Brian also told me that they didn't play any actual golf while shooting these scenes. They hit a lot of balls, but they didn't have time to play much actual short game golf.



[00:41:08] Angela I bet he was bummed because he would have just schooled them all.



[00:41:11] Jenna I think so. And then I texted John, John told me that he absolutely loves playing golf, but he is horrible. I think he's no better than Jim. But he said that the reason Brian Baumgartner likes to golf with John is because that way Brian can really dominate.



[00:41:29] Angela Oh, a little a little shade there at Brian.



[00:41:32] Jenna I guess so.



[00:41:34] Angela Well, that is why it made sense to me that Kevin went because Kevin's on sales. Kevin's an accountant. But I thought I wonder if the writers were like, we need one guy that looks like he knows what he's doing.



[00:41:45] Jenna Well, Lee gave an interview after this episode aired because someone had asked that very question why Kevin? And he said after they picked who would go to the job fair, they had to look at who was left because remember, Jim is trying to woo a client. So we learned from this deleted scene that he brought Andy as his way of maybe being able to have this common enemy over the Dartmouth Cornell thing. And he brought Kevin maybe because he was the last, best athletic choice in the office.



[00:42:17] Angela It works.



[00:42:18] Jenna I also think Kevin provided them with that extra storyline of the betting because that tracks for Kevin's character.



[00:42:26] Angela Yeah, it's the time he's good at math.



[00:42:28] Jenna Yeah, exactly. Well, back at the job fair, literally, no one is interested in Dunder Mifflin, so Michael is going to have to revisit this idea of hiring Justin.



[00:42:40] Angela Oh, and lady, there is a deleted scene that really explains why Michael is like, well, I guess I should reach out to Justin. There's sort of like a young, hip like student that walks by and Michael chats him up. And the guy is just being nice, right? The kid is being nice and Michael is just relentless and just wants him to be his best friend, like literally wants him to be his best friend. And the kid's like, OK, you know what, you're starting to creep me out. I was just trying to be nice. I don't want to work at your stupid paper company. And Michael is devastated. And that is when he sort of has this moment of like, oh, crap. Like Justin's the only one that's interested.



[00:43:19] Jenna Well, Michael brings Justin around and introduces him to everyone. But in the process of introducing Pam, he says she'll do you. I mean, just kidding. But she has dated two guys in the office, that we know of. And this leads to one of my favorite lines of the whole series.



[00:43:40] Angela Is that what Michael says?



[00:43:41] Jenna Yes, Pam walks away and Michael says to Justin, listen, I wouldn't say this to her face, but she's a wonderful person and a gifted artist.



[00:43:50] Angela He wouldn't say it to her face.



[00:43:52] Jenna I feel like it's Oscar delivery of Oscar line that makes me laugh so hard because he goes, why wouldn't you say that to her face?



[00:44:01] Angela I know.



[00:44:02] Jenna Love that couplet. That joke is so funny to me.



[00:44:05] Angela So you guys, not only has Michael been in deleted scenes, ditched by the hip cool kid. Right. He then sees Justin being chatted up by the Air Force recruiter. And in a deleted scene, Michael walks over in the Air Force recruiter is telling Justin how amazing he is, what a great asset he would be. And Michael is like, no, no, no, no, no, no, you need to work for us. He gets really sort of aggressive and offers Justin this job. And that part makes it into the episode where Justin declines. But there's a whole other scene where the Air Force is really going after Justin.



[00:44:39] Jenna Wow. Justin's two choices are the Air Force or Dunder Mifflin paper. Those are real different sides of the pendulum there.



[00:44:47] Angela Very different. And Michael says to the Air Force recruiter, you're telling me this guy could be a fighter pilot? And he's like, yes, he can. And Michael's like, ugh.



[00:44:57] Jenna My God. Well, a woman comes to the microphone and announces that the job fair is coming to an end.



[00:45:06] Angela Yes.



[00:45:07] Jenna And that woman was played by our female stand in Laurie Saux.



[00:45:12] Angela Yes. If you go to fifteen minutes fifty eight seconds, you will see Laurie. We loved Laurie and her husband, Stephen. They're husband and wife, stand in duo. They were with us for years. They were like family.



[00:45:24] Jenna Well, you might remember Stephen because he was featured at the dinner table in Benihana Christmas.



[00:45:30] Angela Yes.



[00:45:31] Jenna And so from time to time, they pop up in episodes. And like Angela said, these guys really are like family to us. Stephen and Laurie have two kids.



[00:45:40] Angela And Laurie had Sophia before I had Isabelle in Jenna, she was my person I went to. I'd be like, Laurie, I'm feeling this or I'm doing this, or I had a question about breastfeeding. And she was just always there to sort of guide me through being a working mom. It was Laurie and Melora. They were the two moms I went to.



[00:45:58] Jenna Yes. Yeah. Both of her kids were born while we shot The Office. So her daughter Sophia is thirteen.



[00:46:06] Angela I know, her and Isabel are very close in age.



[00:46:09] Jenna And their son Liam, who just turned ten years old.



[00:46:13] Angela I cannot believe he's ten.



[00:46:14] Jenna I know.



[00:46:15] Angela Passage of time. You see it in your children.



[00:46:17] Jenna Well, their son Liam has Down syndrome. And Stephen and Laurie actually have this amazing podcast. And we want to shout it out. It's called If We Knew Then. And it is a Down's Syndrome advocacy podcast for parents. Their goal is to reach as many parents and prospective parents as possible. The podcast features interviews and positive information about Down's syndrome, advocacy and inclusion. You guys definitely check it out.



[00:46:45] Angela Check it out.



[00:46:46] Jenna Again. It's called If We Knew Then.



[00:46:48] Angela It is so good. I just listened to their episode where they talk about the week that they had Liam in the hospital and everything they were journeying through in that moment. And they are so kind, relatable, thoughtful, caring people. I really enjoyed their conversation. We're just so happy to share about their podcast. We're going to put them in our stories. We'll put a swipe up to your podcast, guys.



[00:47:11] Jenna And Laurie and Stephen, we just love you guys so much. It is so fun for me to see them pop up in these episodes. We saw them every day at work. So we're excited that they've been memorialized in the episode for everybody.



[00:47:24] Angela Yes. And Stephen is still part of that very competitive fantasy football league of The Office cast and crew.



[00:47:30] Jenna Yes, Lee told me that actually Stephen is responsible for the draft pick numbers every year, and there is a tradition where he makes a video of Sophia and Liam reaching into a bowl and picking out the numbers for the order of the draft. That's how all these guys find out their pick number is from Sophia and Liam every year.



[00:47:51] Angela I love our Office family. I love it. Well, you guys, Michael is getting desperate and he's going to do that classic thing that Michael does where he has to go up on stage and take the microphone.



[00:48:02] Jenna Yeah.



[00:48:02] Angela  He wants to know if anyone wants to intern at Dunder Mifflin. He says they do not offer college credit and they cannot give you any sort of pay. But it's a super fun work environment. Anyone? Show of hands? Anyone?



[00:48:15] Jenna Yeah, it's amazing. I mean, security comes pretty quickly.



[00:48:20] Angela Yes, I know. With Laurie, like, marching right in front.



[00:48:22] Jenna Yeah. It's not going to go great. They're going to leave with no interns.



[00:48:27] Angela They're going to leave with no interns and no one ever wanting to work there. Thanks, Michael.



[00:48:31] Jenna Speaking of Dunder Mifflin and working there, we should probably catch you up on how it's going between Dwight and Angela back at the office. First, they had to make some copies.



[00:48:41] Angela I took a screen grab of this scene of us making copies. It really perfectly shows how much they had to crop me out.



[00:48:49] Jenna Oh, yeah, you're shoulders up.



[00:48:51] Angela I know.



[00:48:52] Jenna Can I say something that I noticed about this scene?



[00:48:55] Angela OK.



[00:48:56] Jenna There's only two people in the office. Apparently you need to make copies at the same time. So there there's a line.



[00:49:03] Angela Mm hmm.



[00:49:04] Jenna There's also a copier in the annex. I think Angela just wanted to stand close to him.



[00:49:10] Angela I think she did, too. I think her heart is melting a little. You know, it's taken her a bit. He did freeze her cat. So she's had a lot to unpack there. But I think she's softening.



[00:49:23] Jenna Well, Dwight's going to sneeze and Angela is going to say bless you.



[00:49:28] Angela I know. I think it's the beginning, the beginning of the Angela and Dwight rekindling.



[00:49:33] Jenna And I have more evidence. If you needed more.



[00:49:38] Angela What?



[00:49:39] Jenna As they're leaving for the day, Dwight holds the door, he waits and holds the door for Angela and she says, thank you.



[00:49:47] Angela I know.



[00:49:48] Jenna I mean, this is in their language, like this is on again, almost.



[00:49:55] Angela Oh, yeah. They're about to go to the warehouse and hook up.



[00:49:58] Jenna Right, exactly. Exactly.



[00:50:01] Angela That's about to happen.



[00:50:03] Jenna Well back at the golf course, turns out Kevin did OK. He wants to collect his money from all of his winnings. But Mr. Maguire says, no, no, no, we'll start a tab because I'm going to play more golf with you guys.



[00:50:15] Angela Hmm.



[00:50:15] Jenna He'll play more golf with them, but he refuses still to give Jim his business.



[00:50:21] Angela But Jim is going to take no for an answer.



[00:50:23] Jenna No, he's going to throw himself in front of this man's car.



[00:50:27] Angela Yeah.



[00:50:28] Jenna I found it a little off-putting,



[00:50:31] Angela Jim said he said he would call him every day until he gave him his business.



[00:50:35] Jenna Well, it works on Mr. McGuire.



[00:50:38] Angela I feel like Jim is using Dwight sales tactics.



[00:50:43] Jenna He's certainly exercising persistence and I guess it pays off. Mr. McGuire says, OK. There you go. It worked. And they're going to come back to the office and they're going to be drinking some beers, toasting their good fortune as Michael and Pam and Oscar and Darryl return from the job fair.



[00:51:05] Angela And Pam is like, you did it. You close the deal, you sold it. And she runs up and they smooch. Then they shake hands because they're like awkward and then they completely make out in front of everyone.



[00:51:17] Jenna Angela, I remember shooting this scene,



[00:51:19] Angela PDA. Awkward.



[00:51:21] Jenna We were kissing for so long,



[00:51:24] Angela It felt like a long time.



[00:51:25] Jenna And it's not even hardly on camera now that I see the episode.



[00:51:30] Angela You're like dang it.



[00:51:31] Jenna I'm like, wait a second. But part of this big kiss was because we had this shorter season from the writers' strike and we didn't get to advance a lot of Jammy storylines after all, right? They had this whole plan that they were going to move in together. So we're near the end of the season and we had to throw in big Jam moment.



[00:51:53] Angela Right.



[00:51:54] Jenna So here it is. You're going to get to see him have a big smooch. This is, I think, the biggest smooch of the series. Really.



[00:52:02] Angela It's the longest smooch. I would say the biggest, most epic smooch was casino night.



[00:52:07] Jenna That was not as long as this.



[00:52:09] Angela Well, that's what was about to say. I feel like it was a big pivotal smooch. But this is the longest smooch.



[00:52:15] Jenna Yeah. And it was very, very funny. Angela, this is my question. Was it in the script for Michael to say, kiss her. Kiss her good? Because I could not get through that. We were laughing so hard and my memory is that Steve did that as an improvization.



[00:52:36] Angela It's in the script.



[00:52:38] Jenna Oh my gosh.



[00:52:40] Angela It's in the script. It says Michael has gotten very close to Jim and Pam and is watching them kiss from really far too close. And Michael says, yeah, kiss her, kiss her good.



[00:52:50] Jenna It was very, very funny. And you can see when John and I separate that my face is a little red. It's a little chaffed from so much kissing. We had to do this scene so many times. And you can see, I think John had a little stubble.



[00:53:07] Angela A little stubble. Well, do you want to hear what was in the script?



[00:53:10] Jenna Yeah.



[00:53:11] Angela Angela and Dwight were there for this moment.



[00:53:13] Jenna What?



[00:53:14] Angela Yes. And while the guys are drinking beers, Angela shushes them. And then Angela and Dwight have their moment later in the script when they leave and Dwight holds open the door and all that. But how awkward would it have been for Dwight and Angela to be there, too? I'm glad they changed that.



[00:53:32] Jenna Yeah, that was a good move.



[00:53:34] Angela Yeah. You don't need more Angela judgment. Pam doesn't need more.



[00:53:38] Jenna The last scene of this episode is a flashback back to the job fair. This is going to set us up for Pam's storyline in season five. We're going to plant some seeds here. You see Pam go up to a booth for a graphic design firm and she wants to fill out an application.



[00:53:56] Angela Yes. And you guys might notice that the graphic design guy is played by Nelson Franklin. He's going to come back in season six as the I.T. guy. I have a little fun tidbit about Nelson.



[00:54:09] Jenna I know what it is. Tell us.



[00:54:11] Angela Nelson and I were costars on a new show for Netflix #BlackAF, and we played writers in the writers room with Kenya Barris. And Rashida Jones plays Kenya's wife, Joya and Ken Kwapis directed us. It was like a whole Office reunion.



[00:54:28] Jenna That show is so funny. Your writers room scenes are so funny. Angela, your character is amazing in that show,



[00:54:35] Angela I play yet another miserable woman.



[00:54:39] Jenna You're so good at it.



[00:54:40] Angela Oh, thanks. I loved all the writers room bits, you know, because you and I, we've observed writers rooms over the years and it was really fun to kind of play out some of that schtick.



[00:54:50] Jenna Well, Nelson is amazing. He also had a regular recurring role on Veep. He had a regular role on Black ish. And it's true, he's going to come back in season six. And I don't know how they did that. I'm going to figure it out when we get to season six. I'm going to tell you.



[00:55:08] Angela It's a little bit of a Bewitched moment, isn't it? It like it's like which Darren is this. I will point out one thing. Nelson joins our very tall male cast member club. He is six foot five. Every scene I have to be in with him, he has to be seated.



[00:55:23] Jenna Well, he's really good in the scene with Pam. You know, he kind of explains to her, you just need, like, basic knowledge of all of these programs that Pam has no knowledge of at all. And then he says, you know, you could probably get training somewhere or do you like an adult education class. But the best place to go- and this is where we plant the seeds for next season- the best place to learn about graphic design are programs in New York or Philadelphia. And she's like, got it. New York or Philadelphia.



[00:55:51] Angela Yeah. What is Pam going to do?



[00:55:55] Jenna We'll find out.



[00:55:56] Angela We will. And that was Job Fair. And lady, I can't believe I'm saying this, but up next is the finale of season four.



[00:56:05] Jenna I know. Already.



[00:56:07] Angela Thank you guys so much for sending in your questions and comments. Thanks so much to our cast members for letting us bug them about golf and pumpkin out and everything else we hit them up for.



[00:56:17] Jenna Yeah, they're amazing.



[00:56:19] Angela They are the best. And Laurie and Stephen Saux, we love you guys. We'll be putting his swipe up to their podcast, If We Knew Then.
