Office Ladies | Episode 150 â€“ A Conversation with Billie Eilish



Jenna [00:00:03] I'm Jenna Fischer. 



Angela [00:00:04] And I'm Angela Kinsey. 



Jenna [00:00:05] We were on The Office together. 



Angela [00:00:07] And we're best friends. 



Jenna [00:00:08] And now we're doing the ultimate Office rewatch podcast just for you. 



Angela [00:00:12] Each week, we will break down an episode of The Office and give exclusive behind the scenes stories that only two people who were there can tell you. 



Jenna [00:00:19] We're the Office Ladies. Hello, everybody. 



Angela [00:00:25] Hi. 



Jenna [00:00:26] We are very excited about today's episode. 



Angela [00:00:32] We are so excited! Ahh! 



Jenna [00:00:32] So we have arrived in our rewatch to Threat Level Midnight. 



Angela [00:00:35] Mm hmm. 



Jenna [00:00:36] But we are not breaking that down this week. 



Angela [00:00:38] No. 



Jenna [00:00:38] We're actually going to be breaking that down next week with writer B.J. Novak. 



Angela [00:00:43] Yes!



Jenna [00:00:44] So if you do not already subscribe to Office Ladies, you might want to hit that subscribe button so you don't miss that one. 



Angela [00:00:50] Yes. And go over to Office Ladies on Instagram because we're going to be posting lots of photos and behind the scenes stuff that I think we need to talk about what's about to happen today. This week, we thought we might reach out to someone who loved this episode of The Office and is a huge Office fan. So much so, she even sampled the episode in one of her songs. 



Jenna [00:01:12] Let's hear it. 



Michael Scott [00:01:13] No, Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died. 



Andy [00:01:21] There's a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn The Scarn. 



Billie Eilish [00:01:27] (SINGING) Don't ask questions you don't wanna know. Learned my lesson way too long ago. To be talking to you, Belladonna, shoulda taken a break, not an Oxford comma. Take what I want when I wanna. And I want ya. 



Jenna [00:01:46] That's right. Billie Eilish is in the studio today to have a conversation with us about her love of The Office. 



Angela [00:01:55] Oh my gosh! 



Jenna [00:01:55] I know! I can't believe it. You guys obviously know Billie Eilish from her amazing music career. At just 20 years old, she has won multiple Grammys. She's won an Academy Award. 



Angela [00:02:05] I mean, People's Choice Awards, Kids Choice Awards, Billboard Music Awards, I Heart Music Awards. 



Jenna [00:02:10] Name an award and she is probably won it. She also is a director. She directs her music videos. She has a book. She has a fragrance. Her new album is called Happier than Ever. It is out now. You can find out about all this stuff on her website, BillieEilish.com, including her tour dates. 



Angela [00:02:28] And she's a super fan of The Office. 



Jenna [00:02:31] Like super fan. 



Angela [00:02:32] Super super fan. And we are super fans of hers. 



Jenna [00:02:35] So much so that we brought our kids in today. Yes, and here they are. They're in the studio. You guys want to say hi? 



Kids [00:02:41] Hi. Hi. Hi. Hello. Hi. 



Angela [00:02:46] Awww those are our kiddos! Yay!



Jenna [00:02:49] Are you guys excited to meet Billie? 



Kids [00:02:51] Yes! 



Angela [00:02:52] We are, too. 



Jenna [00:02:53] Yeah, for about a year now, Harper, you've been asking me what? 



Harper [00:02:58] Hi! When can we meet Billie?



Angela [00:03:00] Yeah. 



Jenna [00:03:00] Yeah. You said if Billie ever comes on the podcast, can I please come meet her? 



Angela [00:03:05] Well, we should probably scooch on out of here, because we just got a text that she's moments away. 



Jenna [00:03:09] Okay, let's take a break. And when we come back, Billie Eilish is going to be here! 



Angela [00:03:14] Woo hoo! Yay! 



Jenna [00:03:20] Yeah! 



Angela [00:03:20] Billie Eilish is here today on Office Ladies. 



Jenna [00:03:23] Billie Eilish is here. 



Billie Eilish [00:03:27] I'm here! Hi, guys! 



Jenna [00:03:27] Thank you for coming. 



Billie Eilish [00:03:28] Thank you for having me. 



Angela [00:03:29] In studio right here right with us. 



Billie Eilish [00:03:31] I know. We're all together.



Jenna [00:03:32] We're really excited to talk all things Office with you. 



Billie Eilish [00:03:35] Oh, me too. 



Jenna [00:03:36] Where should we start? 



Billie Eilish [00:03:37] Oh, my gosh. Wherever you would like. 



Angela [00:03:40] Okay, I'm going to kick us off. How did you discover The Office? Was it with your family? Did you watch it with your folks? 



Billie Eilish [00:03:46] Well, okay. So as a little kid, when this was all starting, I didn't watch it as a kid because it's not a kid show. 



Angela [00:03:54] It's not super appropriate. 



Billie Eilish [00:03:55] It's not. But I would hear it all the time and I would hear people talk about it. And "that's what she said" was constantly being said. And I remember it was a really big part of my childhood was not understanding what that's what she said meant. 



Angela [00:04:07] Oh, no!



Billie Eilish [00:04:07] And I would I would get very, very frustrated. And I would ask people, what does that mean? And nobody would explain it to me. I don't ever remember hearing the first time about The Office. Like, it was just. I just knew about it forever. 



Angela [00:04:20] It was, like, beginning. It was part of you.



Jenna [00:04:21] Yeah. 



Billie Eilish [00:04:22] I don't remember finding it. I don't remember hearing about it. I just. It was just part of life. It was like you learn to speak and you don't there's not, like, a day that you learn to speak, you just speak. Know what I'm saying? So that was kind of with The Office. And then I just didn't understand, "that's what she said". And I remember there was a specific moment, I must have been nine years old, and I was sitting in my kitchen and my mom had a bunch of people over that I didn't really know. And somebody said something and somebody said, That's what she said. And everybody laughed. And I remember understanding it for the first time and being like, I know. I figured it out. And then that was like I was like, okay, I got it, I got it. 



Angela [00:04:58] You're like, TWSS! 



Billie Eilish [00:05:00] Yes. And then I got like into that and then I must have started watching it when I was probably 11. 



Jenna [00:05:07] Do you remember the first episode you saw? 



Billie Eilish [00:05:10] I think I started it from the beginning. 



Jenna [00:05:11] Really! 



Billie Eilish [00:05:12] I've seen it now, I believe about 30 times. 



Angela [00:05:15] 30 times!? 



Billie Eilish [00:05:16] All the way through. 



Angela [00:05:17] You're a purist. Yeah. 



Jenna [00:05:18] Do you only watch it in order? Do you skip around? 



Billie Eilish [00:05:22] Sometimes I skip a specific episode. 



Angela [00:05:25] Oh, I can't wait to hear that. 



Billie Eilish [00:05:29] It's honestly like Scott's Tots. I can't handle it. 



Jenna [00:05:32] Oh, is that the cringiest for you? 



Billie Eilish [00:05:34] Can't do it. 



Angela [00:05:35] It's so cringe. 



Billie Eilish [00:05:37] The second hand embarrassment. I just can't handle it. 



Jenna [00:05:39] When we've been doing our rewatch, the one that hit me hard was Prince Family Paper. 



Billie Eilish [00:05:45] Yeah. 



Angela [00:05:45] That broke my heart. 



Jenna [00:05:46] When they when they take down that sweet family paper company. 



Billie Eilish [00:05:50] And how bad he feels about it. 



Jenna [00:05:52] I mean. 



Billie Eilish [00:05:54] It's heartbreaking.



Jenna [00:05:54] I don't think I could watch that one again. I think I'd have to skip it. That was hard for me. 



Billie Eilish [00:05:59] Well so for you guys, have you guys watched it all the way through fully or no? 



Angela [00:06:03] Okay, this might break your spirit. 



Billie Eilish [00:06:04] No, it's okay. I get it. 



Angela [00:06:06] We are rewatching it for the first time all the way through together. I mean, we'll catch an episode here or there, like on a plane, or maybe it'll come up on Comedy Central or you know what I mean, over the years. But this is the first time I have sat down and had a full rewatch. Yeah. 



Jenna [00:06:21] Yeah. Watched it in order from beginning to end. 



Angela [00:06:23] Yeah. 



Jenna [00:06:23] When it originally aired, we would get together as a cast and we would have cast screenings on Thursday nights and watch it in each other's living rooms. And so I saw most of the episodes then, but I didn't watch every single episode. And so there's going to be a few that I haven't seen before. I'll be seeing them for the first time, which is crazy. 



Angela [00:06:42] It is crazy. 



Billie Eilish [00:06:44] Oh, my God. You haven't seen all of them? 



Jenna [00:06:46] Not all of them. I would say 98%. 



Billie Eilish [00:06:50] That's so crazy. 



Angela [00:06:50] Yeah. We tried to watch every one when they aired, but it's it is very surreal because you're watching a version of you from, my god, what is it? Like 15 years ago? 



Jenna [00:06:59] Yes. 



Billie Eilish [00:06:59] Yeah. 



Angela [00:07:01] You know, I mean, who is the kid that came up to you that was like, you look like an older version of Pam. And you were like, I am. 



Jenna [00:07:06] I am an older version of Pam. Yeah. 



Billie Eilish [00:07:08] Oh, no. 



Jenna [00:07:09] He said. 



Billie Eilish [00:07:09] When was that? 



Jenna [00:07:10] I was in a Target and he was like, I'm sorry, has anyone ever told you you look like like an older version of the person who played Pam on The Office. And I said, I am an older version of the person who played Pam on The Office. 



Billie Eilish [00:07:26] Oh my god. 



Jenna [00:07:26] And he kind of didn't believe me. He wasn't sure. 



Billie Eilish [00:07:29] I know. It happens. 



Jenna [00:07:29] I mean, a lot of people discover the show through streaming and don't really have a concept of like how old it is, how far it goes back. 



Billie Eilish [00:07:38] I know because it hasn't really aged. I don't feel like it's aged much. It feels it doesn't feel like an old show to me. There are some shows you watch and it's like, this feels old. I mean, maybe like people because of the way the world is, it's aged in terms of humor. 



Angela [00:07:53] We say entertainment was a timestamp of when it was made. 



Billie Eilish [00:07:56] Yes, yes. That's all I think it would be. But it hasn't aged. It has aged very well, in my opinion. 



Jenna [00:08:01] Yeah. It holds up, right? 



Billie Eilish [00:08:03] It does. 



Angela [00:08:03] It cracks me up. 



Billie Eilish [00:08:04] Mhmm. 



Jenna [00:08:05] Billie, I have a question, this is from my daughter Harper. She would like to know if you could only watch one episode of The Office for the rest of your life, which one would it be? 



Billie Eilish [00:08:14] Oh, my God, I wouldn't want to watch just one for the rest of my life. I've thought about this a lot, though. Honestly, rewatching it, I just I fall in love with different parts of it and different episodes every time. But my my favorite kind of- one of my favorites, was my favorite for a long time was was Beach Games. That one really gets me. It just gets me. That the scene where (LAUGHS) actually the scene where Andy is in the sumo suit. 



Angela [00:08:41] The sumo suit, floating away?



Billie Eilish [00:08:43] And then he's like, so sad. And it's just really heart, like, he's, like, slow, like, he's like, oh, it hurts my stomach. Like, the way he's looking at the water. And he slowly just wants to touch the water. And then he falls in, and then you're there. And you're like-



Angela [00:08:59] I can't hear you. What? 



Billie Eilish [00:09:01] So good. 



Angela [00:09:01] He's like, get help! Poor Ed Helms. 



Jenna [00:09:04] You know that's really Ed. And even when he's floating far away, it was not a double. We just floated Ed out in that river. 



Angela [00:09:14] There was a man in a little, like, rowboat thing with a rope tied to Ed, and he would, like, pull him out. 



Billie Eilish [00:09:20] Oh, my God. 



Angela [00:09:21] I know. 



Jenna [00:09:22] I loved that. I got to walk across the hot coals. 



Billie Eilish [00:09:25] Was it, actually hot coals? 



Jenna [00:09:27] No. Did I make you believe it was? 



Billie Eilish [00:09:29] Yeah you did. 



Jenna [00:09:30] Well, you know. 



Angela [00:09:31] Tell her what it was, because I think it's just as painful. 



Jenna [00:09:33] It was. So it was like real lava rocks over they they dug a ditch in the ground and then they kind of filled it with some lights with gels to give it that glow. And then on top of that, they put like real lava rocks. And then along the side were real flames. 



Billie Eilish [00:09:50] Oh, so it was still really warm. 



Jenna [00:09:52] It was sort of warm. Like they were very specific. Do not get near the edges of this fire walk thing, this coal rock. 



Billie Eilish [00:10:00] You still had your bare feet on little sharp little rocks. 



Jenna [00:10:03] Thank you! I say it was like running over a bunch of Lego. 



Billie Eilish [00:10:06] Eek! 



Jenna [00:10:06] That's how that feels. So it was painful, but not because it was hot. Just because it was, like, digging into my feet. 



Billie Eilish [00:10:14] Yeah. And how many times did you do it? 



Jenna [00:10:16] I think we did about three takes. 



Billie Eilish [00:10:17] Okay. 



Jenna [00:10:18] Yeah. So not too bad. 



Billie Eilish [00:10:19] Pretty good. 



Jenna [00:10:20] Yeah. And it was cold. Super, super cold. 



Billie Eilish [00:10:23] What was your guys', like, what was your favorite episode to shoot? 



Angela [00:10:27] Oh, I love this question because it's not what our favorite episode is. 



Billie Eilish [00:10:32] Right. 



Angela [00:10:32] Because filming it is different. 



Billie Eilish [00:10:33] That's what I mean. That's what I mean. 



Angela [00:10:35] Yeah. 



Billie Eilish [00:10:36] Because that's another question of like, what is your favorite episode? What's your favorite episode that you shot? 



Angela [00:10:40] You got a lot of big questions. 



Jenna [00:10:41] I think I can actually sum it up into one answer. 



Angela [00:10:45] Oh? 



Billie Eilish [00:10:45] Okay. 



Jenna [00:10:45] I'm going to say Dundie's, because we were out of the office kind of for the first time, and we were on a location and it had a slumber party feel to it, because we didn't really have trailers or anywhere to go, and we were just hanging in that fake Chilis. 



Billie Eilish [00:11:02] Yeah. Mm hmm. 



Angela [00:11:04] For, like, ou know, 12 hours we were just in that one room. 



Billie Eilish [00:11:07] Yeah. 



Jenna [00:11:08] And it was just fun and funny and nonstop. And I got to be drunk. Or pretend to be.



Billie Eilish [00:11:14] Yeah. 



Angela [00:11:16] Steve improvising with Rainn on that that keyboard. You know? Like Dwight would do different things, and we kept cracking up. 



Jenna [00:11:23] Well, don't give Rainn Wilson a keyboard that makes fart sounds unless. 



Angela [00:11:27] No. Or a burp noise. No.



Billie Eilish [00:11:30] Was he just going crazy with it?



Jenna [00:11:31] To the point where I think they were like, Hey, Rainn, can you let Steve get through one without the sound effect?  



Angela [00:11:38] No, I totally remember because Steve my Steve as Michael was making a speech and Rainn kept hitting the "oh yeah". 



Jenna [00:11:43] Exactly. 



Angela [00:11:46] They were like, okay, you have to stop. 



Jenna [00:11:48] Yeah. 



Angela [00:11:49] So that's your favorite to film and maybe one of your favorite episodes?



Jenna [00:11:52] Yeah. And here's the crazy thing, because, you know, there was a big debate on that episode because we thought it might be the last episode of The Office that ever aired because. 



Billie Eilish [00:12:03] What?



Jenna [00:12:03] Yeah, for that season, we only got picked up for six episodes. 



Angela [00:12:06] Yeah. 



Jenna [00:12:07] And it wasn't looking great. And so we had this big debate. 



Billie Eilish [00:12:11] Can you believe that when you think about it now? 



Jenna [00:12:13] It's weird now. But that was our life for the first two seasons. 



Angela [00:12:17] At they at the end of the sixth episode, they had our names, you know, on paper that they had laminated and velcroed to our trailer doors. And I went and I un-velcroed my paper laminated name. I was like, Well, that was fun. I'm gonna take this home.



Billie Eilish [00:12:30] Oh my god. This was after the six episodes? 



Jenna [00:12:33] This was after. Yeah. This was our season two pick up. 



Angela [00:12:36] Yeah. 



Jenna [00:12:37] And we thought maybe Dundie's would be our farewell. And I remember standing in the parking lot with Greg Daniels and saying, Do we think Jim and Pam should kiss outside of The Dundies just in case there's no more episodes of The Office? Like, should we. Like, should we have it as an alt? 



Billie Eilish [00:12:54] Yeah. Yeah. 



Jenna [00:12:54] And then if they cancel the show, you can put that scene in, and if they don't cancel the show, we'll save it. And Greg said, No. We're not going to give them the option. If they want to see you two kiss, they're going to have to pick up the show. We're not going to give them the footage. 



Billie Eilish [00:13:09] Yes! Yes! That's right. 



Angela [00:13:09] Hold up. Pam does kiss Jim. 



Billie Eilish [00:13:11] She does kiss Jim. 



Jenna [00:13:13] Okay. I think they don't kiss til Casino Night. 



Angela [00:13:16] Are you crazy? She kisses him on the lips!



Billie Eilish [00:13:17] It's literally you! 



Jenna [00:13:19] I know! But it was like it was like a sloppy, fall into you kiss. It wasn't like kisss. 



Angela [00:13:25] Okay. 



Jenna [00:13:26] I say. I know, I know. John and I argued about this, too. 



Angela [00:13:29] You say Jim and Pam's first kiss is Casino Night? 



Jenna [00:13:32] Yes. 



Billie Eilish [00:13:33] Well, that's their first, like, intentional. 



Angela [00:13:37] Smoochy smooch. 



Billie Eilish [00:13:38] Together, you know, consensual kiss. Yeah.



Jenna [00:13:43] Yeah. 



Billie Eilish [00:13:44] Or their first, like, passionate, really, whatever. And yeah, I guess, I guess in Dundies it's more you're drunk and you love him and he's your friend, and you hug him. 



Jenna [00:13:52] My mouth is falling on to his mouth. 



Angela [00:13:54] Okay, well, you better. 



Jenna [00:13:55] You know what I mean, like, it's like. 



Angela [00:13:57] I don't know about this arg- this argument is getting weaker for me. 



Billie Eilish [00:14:01] Yeah, yeah it is! 



Jenna [00:14:02] No, but, you know, when we talked to John about it, John was like, from Jim's perspective. 



Angela [00:14:07] They kissed! 



Jenna [00:14:08] That he got a kiss from this girl that he's liked forever. 



Billie Eilish [00:14:11] Yeah. Yeah. Wouldn't you? Yeah, I would. I would agree with Jim's perspective. 



Angela [00:14:16] Yeah, I get it though. 



Jenna [00:14:17] I know. I hear. I hear it all. What about you, Ange? What's your favorite episode to shoot and or to? 



Angela [00:14:23] Oh, man, this is so hard. I loved filming the Christmas episodes. They were so huge. My character always lost her mind. You know what I mean? 



Billie Eilish [00:14:31] Yeah, every time. 



Angela [00:14:32] Just screaming and throwing ornaments and stomping. And I loved all of that. So filming Christmas was really fun. I loved the scene in Yankee Swap when we all sat in a circle and traded gifts. 



Jenna [00:14:44] Mm hmm. 



Angela [00:14:44] And I got that jazz poster. Babies playing jazz instruments. 



Billie Eilish [00:14:47] Some people like these. Such a good line. 



Angela [00:14:50] Yeah. Oh, my. And it hung by my desk for, like, years. 



Billie Eilish [00:14:52] Yeah. 



Angela [00:14:53] I have one at home. I do. And I but I feel weird putting it up cause it has babies, like, with the playing instruments. 



Billie Eilish [00:15:01] Yeah. 



Angela [00:15:02] Okay. But what my favorite episode is is changing all the time now that we're rewatching it. 



Billie Eilish [00:15:06] See, here's what I'm saying. I feel the same. 



Angela [00:15:08] And I rewatched- oh, God, it was so funny, with my daughter I rewatched The Deposition. My character is barely in it. Like, really, I don't I don't think I have a single line in it, Jan in that deposition, and then when they get Michael's journal and his journal is so dorky, but it's like I'm dorky when I journal. 



Jenna [00:15:26] Oh, we know, Ange. 



Angela [00:15:28] Oh, it's really embar- 



Billie Eilish [00:15:29] You journal? I love to journal. 



Angela [00:15:29] You do?



Billie Eilish [00:15:31] I do. 



Angela [00:15:32] Okay. 



Jenna [00:15:33] You've made Angela so happy. I journal too, but she is such a dorky journaler. 



Angela [00:15:37] Well, we brought in one of my journals that I wrote in my twenties, and I, I was interning on Conan. I was living in New York, and I literally wrote something like, You'll never believe what happened today, but I got to run. Stay tuned. I'll fill you in later. xoxo, Angela. Right? That's like who am I writing to? I'm such a dork. 



Billie Eilish [00:15:56] You're writing to yourself! Your future self. It's a big deal. It's cute. 



Angela [00:16:02] Do you journal, like what do you journal? Is it just like free association or? 



Billie Eilish [00:16:06] I journal. I journal on my phone because it's easier for me. 



Angela [00:16:09] Oh, yeah. 



Billie Eilish [00:16:10] I'm not a I'm not a fast writer and I just journal anything that I think. Because I noticed I've noticed in my life that, you know, you get excited and you tend to lie to yourself about your life and your situation and like how you feel about stuff because you really want to feel something? 



Angela [00:16:27] Yeah. 



Billie Eilish [00:16:27] And then you, you think, well, if I just say that's how I feel then it's how I feel. I've been journaling for a while, but this year I was specifically like, You know what? I feel like I've done a lot of lying to myself about how I'm really feeling. So I'm just going to- because I'm like, because I'm worried people are going to find it or post it or like tell somebody, because that's a big fear of having this this kind of life. And so I just made a decision to to just write down every thought, like with with the comfort that no one's going to read it. No one's ever going to know. I'm not gonna have to worry about it. It's just for me. So I just write freely. Anything that I think, which is dangerous for sure. But it feels really good. It feels a lot better. It makes me feel good!



Angela [00:17:08] Yeah.



Jenna [00:17:09] I have those journals. I have those journals from my twenties, especially, where I lay it all out. And I do have a slight fear that like I'm going to pass away and like my kids are going to find it. 



Billie Eilish [00:17:25] Oh, that's the scariest. 



Jenna [00:17:25] And these are not all the things that my kids need to know about me. So I have an agreement with Angela. 



Angela [00:17:30] Tell her. Tell her what you did.



Jenna [00:17:30] They're in a special cabinet and I showed Angela where they were. 



Billie Eilish [00:17:33] Okay? 



Jenna [00:17:35] And so if anything happens to me, it is Angela's job to go in and burn the journal. 



Angela [00:17:39] And destroy them. 



Jenna [00:17:40] Because they. 



Billie Eilish [00:17:40] Destroy them?! 



Jenna [00:17:41] They're for me. 



Billie Eilish [00:17:44] My god, dude. But this is your legacy, though. Like, you're you. People want your words after you pass on, dude.   



Jenna [00:17:52] Do I want people to have me? I don't know. It's mostly like, that's for me, like and I like to go back and reflect. Like, I like to go back and be like, what was my mind at 27? Where was I? What did I care about? What was I interested in? What was I worried about? You know, and you see patterns over time when you review your journals. I see habits. Habits of thinking. Habits of behavior. It's really fascinating, you know? But it's so personal. I don't I'm not sure. Like, in order to give me the freedom to really write it down, I need to know that Angela is going to burn them if anything happens to me. 



Angela [00:18:31] And I've told her I will torch them. 



Jenna [00:18:33] It's a best friend agreement. 



Angela [00:18:36] I hope the day doesn't come. 



Billie Eilish [00:18:37] That's really sweet. So I'm glad you guys have that.  



Angela [00:18:40] You need a BFF who can torch.



Billie Eilish [00:18:42] I know. The problem is mine are all digital, so that's an issue. Exists forever.



Angela [00:18:45] Well. It does. And I've started a few years ago- I know I'm like a dinosaur, but that that notes app on my phone. So I love to write comedy. I love to, like, study people. So I have a whole notes on my phone. Jenna, I don't even know if I've ever shared this with you, of just observations of people, situations, things that I might find funny. 



Jenna [00:19:07] I have a handwritten notebook of that. 



Angela [00:19:10] You do? 



Jenna [00:19:10] Yeah. I wrote one down the other day. I said, in case I ever need to play characters, I can look at all these notes. Woman who replies her lipstick immediately after finishing a meal. That's a person. 



Billie Eilish [00:19:23] It is. 



Jenna [00:19:24] That's a thing. 



Billie Eilish [00:19:24] That's a full character. I have a question for both of you, because I know what some of this stuff is like. What did you hate doing? Or like the process of of making? 



Jenna [00:19:34] By the end of the run, it was less fun to sit in the background of all the scenes. 



Speaker 4 [00:19:39] I think about that a lot when I'm watching because you guys really be doing that. Like, you guys are in the back of a lot of shots. Everybody. Like all of the the one offs, like the talking heads and and you don't even think when you're watching it. Honestly, I don't even think about it unless, like, I religiously watch like the bloopers of all that stuff. And I and that's when I notice. I'm like, oh my God. Everybody's-



Angela [00:20:04] Leslie David Baker. 



Billie Eilish [00:20:05] Yeah. 



Angela [00:20:05] And Creed are in the back. 



Jenna [00:20:07] Yeah. 



Billie Eilish [00:20:07] In the back of every single one. 



Angela [00:20:09] Yeah. I know. 



Jenna [00:20:11] For nine years. 



Angela [00:20:12] For nine years. 



Billie Eilish [00:20:13] For nine years. 



Angela [00:20:13] I sometimes lucked out because I was behind a partition. And so I could be like, Come on, guys, you can't see Angela. 



Billie Eilish [00:20:19] That's true. I'm outta here. 



Angela [00:20:20] Come on. You can barely see me when I stand up! I know for me, the thing that really got old was the fake pregnant belly. 



Billie Eilish [00:20:28] Oh, I'm sure. 



Angela [00:20:29] Because I had a bodysuit with the belly and it was itchy and heavy. And Jenna had it first. 



Billie Eilish [00:20:36] Right. 



Angela [00:20:36] And she was really griping about it. And I was like, okay, all right, it can't be that bad. 



Billie Eilish [00:20:40] Oh, God. 



Angela [00:20:40] Then I had it and I was like, Are you kidding me with this thing? Like, to go pee? Forget it. You're mic'ed under the-. 



Jenna [00:20:46] It was 20 minutes to get out of it. 



Angela [00:20:49] Yeah, you're under this pillow thing. 



Billie Eilish [00:20:50] Wow. So it's not just a belly? It's like a full piece? 



Angela [00:20:54] It's like a it's. 



Jenna [00:20:55] Like a wet suit. 



Angela [00:20:56] But then a little pocket that a belly goes in. 



Billie Eilish [00:20:59] So your legs and your arms are in that that thing? 



Jenna [00:21:01] Yeah. 



Billie Eilish [00:21:02] Ooh. 



Angela [00:21:02] You step into it. Right. And how about this? We haven't gotten there yet, but when Robert California has this big party, we all go in the swimming pool and they had me swim with that fake belly. Guess what? It absorbs water. 



Billie Eilish [00:21:16] (GASPS)



Angela [00:21:17] I was like blub, blub, blub. I was like, oh, my God. 



Billie Eilish [00:21:20] I'm surprised you didn't sink to the bottom with your tiny self. 



Angela [00:21:22] I know. I got a good core workout. Do you have a favorite season of The Office? 



Billie Eilish [00:21:27] I do. 



Angela [00:21:28] You do? 



Jenna [00:21:29] What is it? 



Billie Eilish [00:21:29] Okay, three, four, and also five. But three and four are like unbelievable. Five is also incredible. Incredible. But three and four, like, it's just like Jim and Pam get together around there. Things are good. We're like, Michael's not leaving yet. We're in a good zone, man. There's not conflict as much yet. There's not like the senator yet. There's not Robert California yet. There's not Jo. There's not Gabe yet. And it's still it's still it stays really good. But those just couple seasons are just like happiness. 



Angela [00:22:00] Yeah. 



Jenna [00:22:02] Can I bring you into a controversy?  



Angela [00:22:04] What? 



Billie Eilish [00:22:04] Yes, please.  



Jenna [00:22:05] Do you think that it was okay that Jim bought his parents' house and framed Toby without telling Pam first? Where do you stand? Romantic or controlling? 



Billie Eilish [00:22:15] I don't love it. But also people in their relationships have their own what's okay and what's not. 



Jenna [00:22:23] That's a great answer. 



Billie Eilish [00:22:24] Even though these are not real characters, they are in the show. And it's not. It's up to it's up to Pam whether it was okay or not. Not me, you know what I mean?



Angela [00:22:33] Exactly. And I think it made Pam's like life. She felt so taken care of. 



Billie Eilish [00:22:36] And also what I liked was that at first you're like, you bought this without telling me? And like, look at all these weird things going on. And you have this whole concern and everyone that's watching is like, Yeah, what the hell is going on? 



Jenna [00:22:49] Yeah. 



Billie Eilish [00:22:49] And then it's this, like, very sweet, touching moment of you being like, I love it. Like, look at this. Like, I don't even care about any of the anything but you, you bought me this, you know? You bought me a house. It's amazing. So it's like, I think I think you can see it from from both sides. Like, I wouldn't want someone to do that in my life. But also it's like it depends on the situation and the person and your life and the thing, you know? 



Angela [00:23:14] And I think also what came before it was Roy who was so noncommittal. They were engaged for so long. 



Billie Eilish [00:23:20] Roy sucks. 



Angela [00:23:21] Yes. And then you meet Jim who's like, all in. 



Jenna [00:23:24] Yeah. 



Angela [00:23:25] And how good that must have felt. 



Billie Eilish [00:23:28] Yeah, it's true, actually. And someone who didn't do anything for Pam ever, and then it's like, yeah, maybe it's so far the other direction that it could be too far, but it's so nothing like she's ever experienced that it's like really touching to do that, you know? Which is sweet. 



Jenna [00:23:44] It's interesting because when that episode came up, I said, and we've had these conversations before, what do you do when something has been written for your character. 



Billie Eilish [00:23:53] That you don't agree with. 



Jenna [00:23:54] Yeah, that you're you're like, how, how do I get behind this? I don't know how to wrap my head around it. And Greg said something similar, which is that Jenna wouldn't like this, but Pam does. And very similarly. 



Angela [00:24:06] Hi. 



Jenna [00:24:06] Jenna does not like being tickled, but Pam seemed to respond well to it. When Roy tickles her, she would always like come around. She liked being tickled. And I was like, But this one's really difficult for me because I have a physical like 



Billie Eilish [00:24:22] You and my mom both. 



Jenna [00:24:23] Visceral response to tickling that just causes sort of rage. 



Billie Eilish [00:24:27] Oh, my God, dude, my mother is over there. 



Jenna [00:24:31] Is this true? Am I-



Billie Eilish [00:24:32] Oh yeah. My mom will. 



Jenna [00:24:33] I'm getting a thumbs up from your mom. 



Billie Eilish [00:24:35] Furious. 



Maggie Baird [00:24:35] I have to resist with all my might hitting the person. 



Angela [00:24:39] Yes. yes. 



Jenna [00:24:40] Thank you! I feel seen.



Billie Eilish [00:24:43] Tickling is a serious thing. My brother tickled me. We were in Anthropologie when I was a little kid, and my brother started tickling me and I had an overreaction to make him feel bad. I was like, Oh my God, stop! And I like, swung my whole body and I, I bonked myself on the corner of a table and gave myself a black eye. 



Both [00:25:01] Oh, no!



Billie Eilish [00:25:02] And I always blamed him because he was tickling me. 



Jenna [00:25:05] Did he ever tickle you again? 



Billie Eilish [00:25:06] Yeah. But he, he was scared to, because I'd be like, I'll give myself a black eye and I'll blame it on you. 



Angela [00:25:12] Yeah. 



Billie Eilish [00:25:13] Older brother gets the punishment. But no, I agree that I'd be furious if somebody bought a house and didn't ask me or tell me. Be furious. 



Jenna [00:25:21] Jenna wouldn't like that.  



Billie Eilish [00:25:23] Yeah, but then it's also, like, funny when you sell the house without telling him. Absolutely bonkers when that happens. But then it's like, you have a point. You're like, well, you bought without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you. Every time I hear that line, I'm like, unbelievable. You bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you. 



Angela [00:25:44] I know it's a weird bookend. 



Billie Eilish [00:25:45] Crazy relationship. 



Jenna [00:25:46] Maybe she had been holding on to it a little bit. I don't know. 



Billie Eilish [00:25:50] Clearly. Yeah. 



Angela [00:25:50] Clearly. I mean, every week I had to, like, reconcile with a character that was very different from me. 



Billie Eilish [00:25:57] Oh yeah. 



Angela [00:25:58] All of my reactions, everything. So I can really relate to that. I mean, there were plenty of times where I was like, Okay, can we dial Angela back just a little? Like, can she not always just be the bitch? And I loved that note that Ken Kwapis gave me. He was like, Angela, today, why don't you try being the suspicious bitch? And I was like, Ooh. She's totally different than, like, the strict bitch. Suspicious bitch. 



Billie Eilish [00:26:25] Was there anything in Angela's character that you did, like, resonate with at all? 



Angela [00:26:31] I mean, I do love animals. I mean, I don't know. I haven't ever licked my cat. I did really do that, Billie. 



Billie Eilish [00:26:37] Yeah, I was gonna ask.



Angela [00:26:39] I really licked it. 



Billie Eilish [00:26:40] I love that you did. 



Angela [00:26:42] I mean, they were like, it's just one take. We're just one take. We're going to be a little bit closer. And I was like, Oh, and then I, I licked the cat. But I also like Angela um she's once she's in, she's very loyal. Like, you know? Like I don't think she ever gave up on Dwight, even though they were such a weird on and off again romance. But he was her soup snake, you know? 



Billie Eilish [00:27:08] It's true. 



Angela [00:27:09] So I guess those two things, but pretty much nothing else. 



Jenna [00:27:13] If you were an Office character, which one would you be? 



Billie Eilish [00:27:16] Good one. I've always really resonated with Michael's character. 



Jenna [00:27:20] Okay. 



Billie Eilish [00:27:21] Which is maybe problematic. I just and I. Like I've said that before to, like, my mom or like my parents and my brother and stuff. But it's really true. I, I see a lot of myself in his character. And not some stuff. Like more of just like I can't even really explain it. There's just something that I really, really, really relate to about his character. One of my favorite, favorite moments is when he can't help but shout, "that's what she said" even if he's, like, furious. Like when when she  when she is about to throw the Dundie at the TV, they're having that argument. 



Angela [00:28:02] Oh, yeah. 



Billie Eilish [00:28:03] And he's like so angry and he's clearly just so sad and like, you know, and then she's like, You're hardly my first and he's so angry. But he has this need to say, "That's what she said", because he knows I need to say it. And he just shouts it at her. 



Angela [00:28:19] Michael also just has such a pure heart. He really does. 



Billie Eilish [00:28:22] I know. 



Jenna [00:28:22] Yes. 



Angela [00:28:23] It's he's pretty like just a person who just wants love and to be loved. But he goes about it so wonky. But I'm with you. Whenever he has to yell something, every time I lose it. 



Billie Eilish [00:28:36] Oh, it's so funny. 



Angela [00:28:37] I hadn't seen him yell, I declare bankruptcy until we rewatched it. 



Jenna [00:28:42] Yeah. 



Angela [00:28:42] And just like his need to do that to make this announcement is amazing. 



Billie Eilish [00:28:47] It just hurts my soul how he's like that's how he thinks you you declare bankruptcy is you declare it out lod in a room. 



Angela [00:28:53] It's done. 



Jenna [00:28:54] It's just I've done it. 



Billie Eilish [00:28:55] I just feel that. Okay. And this is a part that that I find so starting starting to watch The Office at a really young age, I almost didn't understand any reference whatsoever. I just thought it was funny and I thought, you know, it was it was funny. I just liked the show in general. But a lot most of the references, I had no idea who anybody was, no idea what movies they were referencing. So something I do blame The Office for, to be honest, is- but then also I blame myself- But I blame The Office is is... There's so many things that are said, especially by Michael, in The Office, that he says wrong on purpose. Like written on purpose. 



Jenna [00:29:36] Yeah. 



Billie Eilish [00:29:37] That I didn't even know the real word. So I said many words wrong because I learned them from Michael Scott. 



Angela [00:29:43] Were you a little stitious? 



Billie Eilish [00:29:46] That one I knew! That one- I'm not a little stitious. That was one that I knew. And I was very proud that I knew that one. But, like, insurmountainable, to be honest, I thought that was a word. I thought. 



Angela [00:29:58] Oh no. 



Billie Eilish [00:29:58] This has happened many times, guys. Many, many times.



Angela [00:30:00] I never thought about this filter of The Office that on a younger person. They're learning Michael's vocabulary.



Billie Eilish [00:30:06] Learning his vocabulary. Because I thought I was learning new words. 



Angela [00:30:11] Oh my god.



Billie Eilish [00:30:13] Which I was. They were just wrong. And then and same when you know the joke when Erin is like my New Year's resolution was to learn a new word every day. 



Angela [00:30:21] Yeah. 



Billie Eilish [00:30:21] And it is going immensely. 



Angela [00:30:23] Yeah. 



Billie Eilish [00:30:24] I didn't get that. I was like, Oh, cool, I'll start saying that. So now, because I have said so many things wrong- Mom, do you remember off the top of your head some more ones that I just said that everyone was like, What the hell? 



Maggie Baird [00:30:38] I remember when you first heard that U2 was from Ireland. 



Billie Eilish [00:30:41] Oh, you guys, you guys, you guys, you guys, you guys, you guys, you guys, you guys.



Jenna [00:30:46] What? 



Billie Eilish [00:30:47] Okay, this is. This is the worst one. Sweet, sweet Bono. Is a supporter of mine. 



Angela [00:30:53] Yeah. 



Jenna [00:30:54] Mm hmm. 



Billie Eilish [00:30:54] And I love him. 



Angela [00:30:56] My God. Amazing.



Billie Eilish [00:30:58] It's Bono. 



Angela [00:30:58] Yeah. My God. 



Billie Eilish [00:30:59] Here's the issue, guys. 



Angela [00:31:00] What? What? 



Billie Eilish [00:31:02] Literally in June. This last June, we were in Ireland. 



Angela [00:31:07] So very recently. 



Billie Eilish [00:31:09] We were in Ireland. And I get. Oh, God. I'm in my hotel. And I get flowers delivered to my hotel room and has a little letter on it. And it's this really, really sweet letter. And it says from Bono. And I was like, Why would Bono, who's from Scranton. 



Angela [00:31:30] You thought Bono was from Scranton, Pennsylvania? 



Billie Eilish [00:31:32] Guys. Yes. I go, why would he send me something in Ireland? 



Angela [00:31:36] Billie! 



Billie Eilish [00:31:37] What does this have to do with him? And it was like, welcome to, like, it was something about, like, welcome to my hometown or something like that. 



Angela [00:31:44] My home. yeah. 



Billie Eilish [00:31:46] But U2 is from Scranton. And I was like, I kept asking everyone like, what was, what is what is Bono doing sending me flowers all the way across the world? 



Angela [00:31:56] From Scranton. 



Billie Eilish [00:31:56] Why would he do that? What is what does this have to do with anything? And they were like, Billie, what are you talking about? They're Irish. I was like, No, they're not. 



Jenna [00:32:04] Have you have you told him this story yet? 



Billie Eilish [00:32:06] No! 



Angela [00:32:07] Oh, my God. 



Billie Eilish [00:32:08] But it's because when when Michael falls in love with Holly and he's making her a mix, and frick, I blame John for this because Jim comes in and Michael goes, What's the band from Scranton that made it big? Is that U2? And Jim goes, Yes. And then he sits down and he goes, You don't love Holly. That's all there is. It's not even there's no pause. There's no laugh. 



Angela [00:32:31] But if you've seen it 30 times, then guess what? U2 is from Scranton.



Billie Eilish [00:32:37] From Scranton! I thought it was like, honestly, in my head, I thought Jim thought, oh, that's a stupid question, because obviously they're the band that made it big from Scranton. And I thought if it was like I thought it was like the question like is, you know, I don't even like it like is yes so and so that's very obviously from this place is they are they from that  place? You're like, yeah, obviously. I thought that was the vibe instead of, no not at all. Their whole thing is that they're Irish. This is in June. June! I didn't know, like I could have been in an interview. Somebody could have asked me about U2 and Bono and I could've been like, well, it's really cool because they're from Scranton. 



Angela [00:33:14] Here's the thing. Here's the thing. We are going to give you our phone numbers. Any time you come up on something like, Is this a real?- just text us. 



Jenna [00:33:23] We'll let you know. 



Angela [00:33:23] We're like your Office aunties. 



Billie Eilish [00:33:24] Yeah. I'm gonna need to do that. 



Jenna [00:33:30] How much do you watch the office? Because I read in an interview that it's like all the time. 



Billie Eilish [00:33:35] Okay, so I play it. It's playing only on my phone. I don't watch it on anything else. It's playing on my phone at all times, when I'm doing anything, when I'm like in the shower, I have it sitting outside the shower. I can't have any silence, guys. It's like right outside the shower. It's like when I'm getting dressed, when I'm eating food, when I put on makeup, when I do my hair, when I, like, it's like truly playing always just in my, like, I'll just honestly, I'll be I was like rearranging my closet a couple of months ago or maybe longer ago, and I was just in my pocket. I couldn't even see it. It was just in my pocket and the audio was playing and it's like I listen to it, like it's a podcast. Like also because I've seen it so many times, I have it all memorized, like all the lines memorized and all the visuals memorized. So I can picture it. I don't. I'm not missing anything. 



Angela [00:34:23] You don't even need to look at it. 



Billie Eilish [00:34:24] I don't even need to look at it. 



Angela [00:34:24] This makes something your mom said to me when we met when you got here, make perfect sense. Maggie said to me, I feel like I know you guys because I hear your voices all the time. And I thought, well, all the time? But yes, all thetime. 



Billie Eilish [00:34:36] It's true. And, you know, I don't live at home anymore, but when I lived at home, it was, I mean, it's just it's just you can just hear it. And I also have, like, weird needs. Again, I have these weird- I have, like a need to like if I'm eating, I have to have The Office playing or something playing, preferably The Office and silence of other otherwise, like nobody- if you talk to me, I'm not there. I'm not. I'm not there. And so but when I was living at home, I'd be like going into my parents' kitchen where my parents were and being like, shhh, and turning on The Office and eating. And being like, Don't talk to me. I'm watching The Office, I'm eating my waffles. Leave me alone. 



Angela [00:35:17] Maggie, we love you. We love you guys. Parents are amazing. 



Billie Eilish [00:35:22] It's true. 



Angela [00:35:22] Okay oh, actually, Jenna, I'm curious. So you're Michael Scott, right Billie? Which Office character are you? 



Jenna [00:35:28] Me? Who am I most like? 



Angela [00:35:30] Yeah. 



Billie Eilish [00:35:31] Ooh. 



Jenna [00:35:31] So I'm most like Pam. Like there was so much of me that was Pam and so much of my early life as a struggling actress that I brought to Pam. I mean, I literally know what it feels like to sit at a reception desk and wish that I had an artistic career. Because I was a receptionist. So I know that longing and I know that feeling of wanting something to change, but feeling like I'm in a place where nothing ever changes. So I definitely could relate to that. But I am an action person, so I'm not a wait for it to come to me person. And I feel like Pam, it was harder for her to get herself started or take movement, you know? So I'm just much more ambitious than Pam. I always say it would not take it would not have taken me like three years to kiss the cutie in the office. 



Billie Eilish [00:36:24] Right. 



Jenna [00:36:25] Like, we're not waiting that long for that. Like that's happening much sooner. Woulda happened at The Dundies, probably, if I were in charge, like for reals, though, you know? Not the. 



Billie Eilish [00:36:36] The falling. 



Jenna [00:36:37] Not the falling on to his lips kiss. Yeah. But I also think I have a tiny bit of Ryan in me. I. 



Billie Eilish [00:36:46] What?! 



Jenna [00:36:46] I have a lot of like. 



Angela [00:36:47] She loves Ryan now in this rewatch. 



Jenna [00:36:50] I have fallen in love with Ryan on this rewatch.   



Billie Eilish [00:36:52] Which version of him? There's serious different versions. 



Angela [00:36:54] Talk about so many versions of a character. 



Billie Eilish [00:36:55] Yeah. That was different. Those are like it's like he's playing different characters. 



Jenna [00:36:59] I think my favorite is Ryan the temp. So I like early Ryan. 



Angela [00:37:06] The OG. 



Jenna [00:37:06] But I guess it's just I have a lot of entrepreneurial ideas that go nowhere, you know, gadgets that I've invented in my mind and things that, you know, never get made. And whatever. We've discussed on the podcast before that with my high school best friend, we invented something called the tan baster. It is um it's a way to put on suntan lotion without getting your hands dirty. It's called the tan baster. 



Billie Eilish [00:37:32] How do you do it? 



Jenna [00:37:33] You know, the thing that you wash dishes with that like, fills with dish soap and then has a sponge on the end? 



Billie Eilish [00:37:38] Yes. 



Jenna [00:37:38] So it's very similar, but with suntan lotion. And then you can also get the middle of your back with it, you know what I'm saying? The tan baster. 



Angela [00:37:46] Look how excited she is about this thing.



Billie Eilish [00:37:47] I know. Bless your heart. 



Jenna [00:37:49] The tan baster!



Angela [00:37:50] Someday I need you-. 



Billie Eilish [00:37:52] Well, let's figure this out. Why aren't you going- go on Shark Tank, dude.



Angela [00:37:52] Yeah, I need you on HGTV. 



Jenna [00:37:55]  I don't know. I mean, I think I should call my friend and we should get it going again. 



Angela [00:38:00] Welcome to celebrity shark tank. Today we have Jenna Fischer. She's made a tan baster. 



Jenna [00:38:03] Can you imagine? It would be so humiliating. 



Billie Eilish [00:38:08] You should do it! You're really passionate about it. You're so passionate, man. You just described it for so long. 



Jenna [00:38:11] But what do you think? What's your honest opinion? 



Billie Eilish [00:38:14] Don't worry about me. I don't know. 



Jenna [00:38:15] It's not happening, is it? Don't send me on Shark Tank just to be humiliated. 



Billie Eilish [00:38:19] There's lots of other inventions that do well that are stupider. 



Jenna [00:38:24] Oh no. 



Angela [00:38:24] Oh, my God. 



Billie Eilish [00:38:26] That are worse. It's not a bad idea. It's really not. I mean, I totally get it. Like, you know, you get your hands all gross when you- I get it. 



Jenna [00:38:34] Especially at the beach, and then you've got sand on your hands. 



Angela [00:38:37] I think you need to let it go. I think you need to let it go. 



Billie Eilish [00:38:40] Oh. 



Jenna [00:38:41] One day, maybe I'll have time. 



Angela [00:38:43] You know what? Tans are going to come back into fashion. And when they do, I don't think tans are in fashion anymore. 



Jenna [00:38:49] No, it's for the suntan lotion. It's for the SPF. 



Billie Eilish [00:38:51] Sunscreen? 



Jenna [00:38:52] The sunscreen. I'm sorry. 



Billie Eilish [00:38:54] Okay, sunscreen.



Angela [00:38:54] All of these years you have told me about this, I thought it's like a spray tan in a tube. 



Jenna [00:39:00] No, lady.



Angela [00:39:01] And I thought. 



Billie Eilish [00:39:01] Applying sunscreen. 



Angela [00:39:02] I thought this is such an uneven tan, it looks like from a sponge. 



Billie Eilish [00:39:06] Well, that would be true if that's what it was for. 



Jenna [00:39:09] Are you behind it now that you understand it? 



Billie Eilish [00:39:10] It's sunscreen.



Angela [00:39:11] I want you to go for this now. I want you to do it.



Billie Eilish [00:39:13] Applying sunscreen. What about your face? 



Jenna [00:39:15] It doesn't work on the face. 



Angela [00:39:17] No squeegee for the face? 



Billie Eilish [00:39:18] Okay, well there's the flaw. 



Jenna [00:39:18] Well, we already have those, like, you know, deodorant sticks that we can put on our face. 



Angela [00:39:24] That's true. 



Billie Eilish [00:39:24] The problem is that the rubbing in is where you you distribute it evenly and so that you actually get all the little cracks and crevices. 



Jenna [00:39:32] Okay. All right. You know what? When-. 



Billie Eilish [00:39:34] Workshop. Just workshop it. 



Jenna [00:39:34] When we were testing that in our focus groups, we're going to think about that. We're going to make sure that we get a sponge that can apply evenly. 



Billie Eilish [00:39:43] So, Ryan, because of your ideas. 



Angela [00:39:46] Thank you for bringing us back. 



Billie Eilish [00:39:46] Sorry. Decided to come back real quick.  



Angela [00:39:49] Oh my god. 



Billie Eilish [00:39:50] Ryan, because of your ideas. What about you? 



Angela [00:39:52] Um. I think I'm a little maybe. Hmm. Maybe a Phyllis Angela combo platter? Maybe a little bit. I'm a little bit Angela. And then Phyllis has a little sass, you know, she hooked up with Bob Vance on the bathroom. 



Billie Eilish [00:40:07] She does. Phyllis is a freak.



Angela [00:40:07] I have a little bit of that. A little bit. I might have a little bit of that combo in me. 



Billie Eilish [00:40:12] Uh huh. 



Angela [00:40:13] What do you think, Jenna? 



Jenna [00:40:14] I think you are way more Phyllis than Angela. There's. There's almost no Angela in Angela except for maybe love of animals. 



Billie Eilish [00:40:23] Mmhm. 



Jenna [00:40:23] But I think yeah, I think Phyllis, I think Phyllis is a strong choice. 



Angela [00:40:28] Maybe with a side of Kelly. Like chatty Kelly. 



Jenna [00:40:30] Yes. Angela is very chatty. 



Billie Eilish [00:40:31] I get that one.  



Angela [00:40:33] I do like to chat. 



Billie Eilish [00:40:33] Yeah, I get it. I feel that. 



Angela [00:40:35] Yeah. Mm hmm. 



Billie Eilish [00:40:35] I feel that for sure. 



Angela [00:40:36] Like I could go to your family reunion and I wouldn't have a problem. I wouldn't miss a beat. 



Billie Eilish [00:40:40] Wow. 



Angela [00:40:41] I could go to your cousin's wedding. I'd have the time of my life.



Billie Eilish [00:40:42] I think that's also like you're a good hang. That's what that is also. 



Angela [00:40:46] Thinks, Billie! Oh my gosh. 



Billie Eilish [00:40:48] When you can just fit right in anywhere you're good. 



Angela [00:40:50] Oh oh oh! I have a thing! 



Jenna [00:40:53] What is it? 



Angela [00:40:53] Okay. Okay. I just got very excited about this. So how many cast members have you met from The Office? 



Billie Eilish [00:41:01] So I've met Creed. 



Angela [00:41:03] Yes. 



Billie Eilish [00:41:03] I've met Rainn. 



Angela [00:41:04] Mm hmm. 



Billie Eilish [00:41:05] You know what's interesting? Oh, I've spoken on the phone with Steve and... 



Angela [00:41:12] Brian? 



Billie Eilish [00:41:14] Yes. Brian. 



Jenna [00:41:15] Who plays Kevin. Mm hmm. 



Billie Eilish [00:41:16] Yeah, that's right. Steve and Brian. I think that. Oh, I've met. I've met. I've met Mindy, and I've met BJ. 



Angela [00:41:22] Mm hmm. 



Billie Eilish [00:41:23] Oh, well, actually. Okay, so two interesting things. When I was a kid, I think I must have been- I'm four years, four and a half years younger than my brother, and he was probably 13 or 14. So I was some some years younger than that. My brother was in Bad Teacher, which is the movie with Cameron Diaz, and I was like a little kid. And I remember going to hang out on set at one point and standing in craft services. And Phyllis was right there. And I hadn't seen The Office. I was like, I must have been like, you know, I was probably like eight or nine or something. And she was standing there and I remember somebody saying, like, (WHISPERS) She's in The Office. And I remember thinking, The Office, like, I know that show. That's really cool. I've never seen it, but that's really cool. And I remember sitting standing right next to her like she was right here and she was eating chips or something and she was having a conversation with somebody. And I just remember looking up at her and being like... She's a star. Like just looking at her. And she doesn't know that. I've never I don't think I've ever spoken to her. That was like a big deal for me. I talked about that for a long time after, and she has no idea that that little kid was me also. But and then the other thing is my mom's one of my mom's long lasting best friends is Amy Ryan. 



Angela [00:42:43] Oh, my gosh! 



Billie Eilish [00:42:45] Holly Flax. So I grew up around. 



Jenna [00:42:47] That's amazing!



Billie Eilish [00:42:48] And so, you know, I knew her- we knew her like, before she was obviously cast. And and then she was just like one of my mom's friends. And then she once I started being a fan of The Office, it it was hard for me to be around her. It was I was- 



Angela [00:43:06] Because she was Holly. 



Billie Eilish [00:43:08] She was Holly right then too. And I was like I was like peak The Office was it. Oh, it was. It was crazy. It was. It was. Yeah. So she she has been in my life for a long time and she has a daughter who's a few years years younger than me. And I we would we would go to their house and like, I'd play with her daughter and it was cool. Yeah, she's. She's great. I love her. She's. She's great. 



Jenna [00:43:33] I love Amy. 



Angela [00:43:34] I love hearing that. Amy is amazing. You know, it's interesting because my daughter, one of my daughter's friends, recently started watching The Office. I have known this little girl. They're 14 now. I've known her since kindergarten. Right? Best friends since kindergarten. She's over at the house the other day, and she was, like, looking at me like this. Like, oh, my God. And I was like, I turned her and I was like, What's that? What's going on? She's like, Sorry. I started watching The Office. Oh, my God. I was like, I have known you forever. But now I'm Angela Martin, you know? And I'm like, oh, my gosh, it's so funny. 



Billie Eilish [00:44:05] You know what the other one was? I used to be a camp counselor and there was this girl and she was like my favorite student at the camp, and her name was Piper, and I loved her to pieces. And her mom would come to pick her up every day. And I was like, That's Jan. That's literally Jan. And I was like, Is your mom Jan? And she was like, ugh yeah. 



Jenna [00:44:26] Oh my gosh! That is crazy! 



Billie Eilish [00:44:29] Like, that's so cool! It's Jan! And I tried not to freak her out because I'm sure she was annoyed with that a lot. But I think about her a lot. I hope she's doing well. 



Angela [00:44:38] Okay. I have a message for you from Creed. 



Billie Eilish [00:44:41] Oh you do? 



Angela [00:44:42] Okay. So Creed is my neighbor. 



Billie Eilish [00:44:44] Really? 



Angela [00:44:44] Yeah. He lives down the street from me. 



Billie Eilish [00:44:46] No way. 



Jenna [00:44:47] Walking distance. 



Angela [00:44:47] Yeah. Like we we sometimes we walk, we call it the sauce trail. We get an adult beverage and a red solo cup, and we go for a walk. And he often comes over and brings his guitar and like, jams out. He'll be like, Ange, I have a new album, you want to hear it? I'm like, Yes. It's it's like one of the joys of my life. But he we were texting because he he loves animal documentaries and he was texting me recently that he wants me to come watch one. And I said, Hey, I said, Have you met Billie Eilish? She's coming into the studio. We're so excited. And he wrote back and he said, Yes, I have. I met her brother also. She's been ghosting me for a while. And then he called me and he said, I'm kidding, pumpkin, I'm kidding. And I said, I figured you were kidding. And he said, I was blown away by her voice. I got to see her in concert. She's amazing. I loved meeting Phineas, too. Ange, will you tell her that if she ever wants to talk music or jam to come over? I'm around. Yeah. 



Billie Eilish [00:45:45] Oh, that's sweet. I met him for, like, a split second. He came to one of my shows. Like three and a half years ago. And I was meeting million people, and I was like (GASP) it's fucking Creed! And I went over and I hugged him and it was really cool. But you know what's funny about like, I love that his, his just all of his musical talent just comes through throughout the show. And what I think is really cool is, you know, when he's singing Spinning and Reeling With Love. 



Angela [00:46:14] Yeah. 



Billie Eilish [00:46:14] At the Christmas party when everybody's doing karaoke, I love that that's in there because it's his song. But you don't know that. And you think you're that you think he's just honestly because here's one more thing is that I watched that thinking this is probably a super famous song everybody knows and he's doing a a karaoke to it. And I always thought the song was really cool. And I find a lot of the music that I love through, through other things and like hearing it in the background of something and looking up the lyrics. And so I remember after a while being like, every time I watch that scene, I'm always like, Oh, that song is really cool. I love, I love whatever song this is. What song is this? And I, I looked it up honestly probably like last year, and I saw that it was his song and I was like, (GASP) it's so cool. 



Angela [00:46:58] He's a great songwriter. He will just come over and play. And I mean, I'm always amazed. I'm amazed when- I love to write, but it's always so interesting for me when people can put music to words because I can't hear music. That's such a gift. Like maybe, maybe some in another life I'll get to hear music in my head like that because that is so cool. And if you can't hear it, when you see people who can, it's like your little piece of magic that you get to witness. It's like, so cool. 



Jenna [00:47:30] Yeah, I'm the same way. My son is a musician. He's a drummer and plays guitar, and from the time he was very little, he would be like three years old, we'd be driving somewhere and from the backseat he would say with this little voice, Mama, you play a song with a lot of ride cymbal, play a song with a lot of ride cymbal. 



Angela [00:47:52] See, like I have no idea what that means. 



Billie Eilish [00:47:53] I don't even know what that means. 



Jenna [00:47:53] And I would say and I said, I said, Baby, I don't know, I don't know what song has a lot of ride cymbal in it. And then he, I mean, I'm going to get it wrong, but then he would say like some Green Day song. 



Billie Eilish [00:48:04] Right. 



Jenna [00:48:04] And then I'd put it on and I'd be like, Holy shit. There's a lot of ride cymbal in this song. 



Billie Eilish [00:48:10] Wow. 



Jenna [00:48:11] And so and and so it is true because I'm seeing that in my own house with this person who can, like, hear music in a way that I just, you know, it's so specific. 



Billie Eilish [00:48:24] It's so interesting hearing that you guys can't. Have you ever tried to write a song? 



Angela [00:48:30] No, I haven't. No, I haven't. I mean, I've written poetry and I've written, you know, I was an English, I was a creative writing major, but I don't know that I can see it. 



Jenna [00:48:41] Well, this is actually a great segway into my next question, which is that you sampled part of the episode Threat Level Midnight. 



Billie Eilish [00:48:49] I did. 



Jenna [00:48:50] For your song My Strange Addiction. 



Billie Eilish [00:48:52] I did. 



Jenna [00:48:52] How did that come about? 



Billie Eilish [00:48:53] Well, first of all, I can't believe they let me do that because that's, I mean, that's wild to do that. Like take audio from a show like The Office that's that big and that, I mean, come on. It was crazy. It was such a pipe dream. I can't even tell you. 



Angela [00:49:11] It is wild that they said yes, because we are now. 



Billie Eilish [00:49:13] That's what I mean. 



Angela [00:49:13] Going back now through emails from NBC and standards and practices and things like that, and they were super particular. 



Jenna [00:49:19] They were. 



Billie Eilish [00:49:20] Yeah. 



Jenna [00:49:20] But I remember all of the people whose voices you hear, like Brian Baumgartner's on there and um. 



Angela [00:49:29] Ed Helms. 



Jenna [00:49:29] You hear Mindy, you hear John. I remember I think you hear BJ. Right? 



Billie Eilish [00:49:34] Yeah. 



Jenna [00:49:34] So I remember- and Steve- I remember each of those individuals had to give permission. 



Billie Eilish [00:49:39] Yes they did. 



Jenna [00:49:39] They were an enthusiastic yes. So they-. 



Angela [00:49:43] No hesitation.  



Jenna [00:49:44] Let me tell you, the Office text thread blew up. 



Angela [00:49:47] Oh, yeah. 



Jenna [00:49:47] When that went out. Like everyone was so excited. 



Billie Eilish [00:49:50] Oh my god. 



Jenna [00:49:51] Yeah, it was very, very cool. 



Billie Eilish [00:49:52] Oh, that's so cool. I mean, so the way that that happened was... Finneas, my brother, had written this song called My Strange Addiction Just the words. And like the whole song. And he was like, Billie, I wrote the song and like, do you think it's cool? And he played it for me, and he had this beat to it that was, like, so goofy. And I was like, Dude, this reminds me of the song that they dance to, The Scarn. 



Angela [00:50:16] The Scarn. 



Billie Eilish [00:50:16] This reminds me of The Scarn. And he was like, What are you talking about? And I played the scene, and it just just when he when he hits that button in the jukebox, and it's like (SINGS INSTRUMENTAL) and it's so, like, it's so stupid, but it's so good. I was like, this is giving me that same feeling of, like, dumb, but kind of groovy as shit. And so we were like, Oh my God, that would be so- and also the song is, it's, it's, you know, kind of a play off of, you know, the show My Strange Addiction. Do you guys know that show? And it's about people with these weird addictions to like, weird stuff. You know, Finneas wrote the song, but it's kind of about like, you know, I've got an addiction, but it's to you. But I kind of was like, well, Ohe office is also my addiction. 



Angela [00:51:03] Your addiction! Yeah. 



Billie Eilish [00:51:04] And this song is kind of goofy, and it reminds me of that scene. And also then we were just watching the scene, and it's like the way that, like, Andy's voice sounds and the way that Steve is just it's just the whole all the dialogue is so good. And we were like, Dude, what? And we jokingly, truly, truly, truly jokingly, like, ripped the audio and just put it in the song. And then it was so perfect because Andy's name is Billy in the scene. 



Jenna [00:51:29] Yeah. 



Billie Eilish [00:51:31] So then it's like, No, Billie, I haven't done that dance since my wife died. And we were like, Oh, that'd be so crazy. Cuz my name is Billie. Yeah, yeah. And so we, like, put it to the song, and there was not any reality that it would work or, like, be okay. But we were like, this is so funny and we sent it to the label and we were like, Dude, like, just can you just ask somebody? We know it's going to be a no, but just ask somebody. There's no way they're going to give us the rights to this at all. No way. And it was like, yeah, absolutely they're not. But we'll ask. Truly. And here we are. 



Angela [00:52:02] And then we did it. You did it. 



Billie Eilish [00:52:03] I know. It's amazing. And it's really cute because, you know, the fans have that whole song memorized. And so when I do it live-. 



Angela [00:52:11] Do they say the parts? 



Billie Eilish [00:52:11] They all shout all the parts.



Angela [00:52:12] Oh my gosh. 



Jenna [00:52:14] Really? 



Angela [00:52:14] Do they- I love- Ed Helms does a lot of great characters. You know, he's so funny like that. 



Billie Eilish [00:52:19] So good. 



Angela [00:52:19] And I loved Ed as Andy. Andy's version of what he thought that bartender was. Like, Hey, youse, you know. 



Jenna [00:52:25] Yeah. 



Billie Eilish [00:52:25] Yeah, it's so good. Oh, it's so good, you guys. 



Angela [00:52:30] Oh. 



Billie Eilish [00:52:30] Guys, I just love this. I just wanted to say.



Jenna [00:52:32] Oh, we're having the best time! 



Angela [00:52:34] I know. I'm just like-. 



Billie Eilish [00:52:35] This is so cool. I'm like-



Angela [00:52:36] I, like, feel like I'm have sort cheeks because I'm smiling so much. 



Billie Eilish [00:52:38] I know I feel the same. And I just there's a lot of things that I love in the world and there's a lot of things that I'm passionate about. And I try not to be like a nerd about it. And truly, when I meet other people that like The Office, I'm like, okay, whatever. Like, I don't care. I'm like, I'm not trying to relate to people about it because it's my own personal thing. And in my head, no one else knows The Office except me. It's my show. And it's not I'm not a I'm not in a club of people. I'm not I am very I'm very pick me about it. I don't know if you guys know what that means, but I'm very like, no, no one's ever seen. It's like how you kind of like you joke about like your boyfriend and, No, he's never dated anybody but me. 



Angela [00:53:16] Oh, right, right. 



Billie Eilish [00:53:17] I'm the only person he's ever been with. 



Angela [00:53:18] Right. 



Billie Eilish [00:53:18] That's how I feel. The Office is like. 



Angela [00:53:20] It was made for you. 



Billie Eilish [00:53:21] Made for me. You guys shot for nine years just for me. 



Angela [00:53:24] On your phone. 



Billie Eilish [00:53:24] Nobody's seen it before. Yeah, yeah, on my phone. But. But truly, like, I don't. I don't really talk about it, like. Like, Oh, yeah, and my favorite show, The Office, da da da da. It's truly like such a deeper thing than that, that when people are like, So I heard your favorite show is The Office, I'm like, Don't say that. It's somehow disrespectful. 



Angela [00:53:44] It's sacred. 



Billie Eilish [00:53:44] It's sacred. It's like a, it's truly like a sacred part of, of my personality and, and so much of who I am and the things that I do and say and think. Like and also I just I base a lot of my life situations on TV shows and like scenes from stuff. And the amount of like one of my best friends many times earlier this year I'd we'd be like in a really deep conversation about like something really serious in my life. And I'd just take a pause and she'd be like, Oh my God, I know just what you're going to say. And I'll be like, Well, well, but I have to. There's this one scene in The Office where, like, this is happening, and I just I use it as like a this reminds me of that one scene and and how they feel here. And I really feel like that right now. It's it's stupid, guys. Like you really you really have uh raised me in a way. 



Angela [00:54:36] There are things that when they sort of get like, I don't know what the phrase is, but like kind of in your bones, you know what I mean? Like then they become sacred to you. And like, if someone asks you about it, you're like, okay, first of all, how dare you? 



Billie Eilish [00:54:48] I know. 



Angela [00:54:49] That is mine. 



Billie Eilish [00:54:50] I know. 



Angela [00:54:50] But at the same time, you're like, okay, yeah. 



Billie Eilish [00:54:54] Let's talk about it. Yeah. 



Angela [00:54:55] How well do you know it? Don't even come at me. Don't even. 



Billie Eilish [00:54:57] I know. Well, that's the other thing is people are like, I love that and I'm like I reference the shit out of this show. And I'll go, does anybody in this room know The Office well enough to know like specific details? And people go like, Yeah, for sure. And I'm like, I just know it's not true. I go, okay, so do you know in, you know, this one episode where, where Michael is like doing this and then he's doing this and then somebody comes in and and everybody's like, No, sorry. I don't know. And and also what's cool is my brother, who's seen The Office many times, he and his girlfriend who's seen The Office kind of the way everybody has where you've seen it. She's never really watched it all the way through. And so they've been watching it all the way through for the first time, like as a whole since it came out for for Finneas too. And so for him, everything's really fresh. And so he's finally like, Oh, Billie, we were watching we were watching The Deposition the other day. And that one scene, what does he say? And I'm like, Oh, you mean da da da. 



Jenna [00:55:54] Yeah, yeah. 



Billie Eilish [00:55:55] Oh, so this and this. And also, like, sometimes he'll just he'll reference something that he just watched and I'll immediately get the reference and be able to like recite the rest of the scene. Which. 



Angela [00:56:05] It's like a whole new level of like you're like your siblinghood. 



Billie Eilish [00:56:08] It really is. 



Angela [00:56:09] Cuz you have a whole new layer. 



Billie Eilish [00:56:10] Like, wow. You can finally. 



Angela [00:56:11] You see me. 



Billie Eilish [00:56:12] Yeah. Oh, it's cool. 



Jenna [00:56:13] Do you want to do a scene with us? 



Angela [00:56:15] Oh, yes! 



Billie Eilish [00:56:16] Do I want to do a scene? 



Jenna [00:56:17] Do you want to be in a scene with us? 



Angela [00:56:18] Come on. Come on. 



Jenna [00:56:19] We printed out a scene from the show. 



Billie Eilish [00:56:21] What scene?



Angela [00:56:21] I mean, first of all, Billie, I went to our actual shooting draft, so this is as we held it in our hands on-. 



Billie Eilish [00:56:28] Wow. 



Angela [00:56:29] Let's see. Oh, my gosh. In 2004. This is from 2004. 



Billie Eilish [00:56:34] I was two, you guys. 



Angela [00:56:35] Oh, my God. She was two years old. Look, I highlighted your parts. Jenna, you will play Pam. 



Jenna [00:56:41] Okay. 



Billie Eilish [00:56:42] Wow. 



Angela [00:56:44] Billie, you're going to play Phyllis. We are going to do the first ever party planning committee scene. 



Billie Eilish [00:56:51] Oh, yeah. I know this scene quite well. 



Angela [00:56:53] Season one, episode four, The Alliance. 



Billie Eilish [00:56:57] Sure is. 



Angela [00:56:58] Okay, I'm going to also read our stage direction. Party planning committee. Here we go. Interior Conference Room. Pam, Phyllis and Angela; The party committee. 



Billie Eilish [00:57:14] Well, for decorations, maybe we could do. No, that's stupid. Forget it. 



Angela [00:57:19] What? 



Billie Eilish [00:57:21] Well, I was going to say we could have streamers, but that's dumb. Everybody has streamers. Never mind. 



Angela [00:57:28] No. Yeah, I think that's a good idea. What color do you guys think? 



Billie Eilish [00:57:34] Well, there's green, blue, yellow, red. 



Jenna [00:57:40] How about green? 



Angela [00:57:42] I think green is kind of whore-ish. 



All [00:57:43] (CHEER) 



Angela [00:57:48] You're officially in the PPC! 



Billie Eilish [00:57:51] So scary. 



Jenna [00:57:51] We actually have for you. 



Billie Eilish [00:57:54] What do you have? 



Jenna [00:57:55] Since you are in the party planning committee now, we have a party planning committee sweatshirt for you. It's official.



Billie Eilish [00:58:01] Oh my god. 



Jenna [00:58:02] You can plan. 



Billie Eilish [00:58:04] Look at that. 



Jenna [00:58:04] As many parties as you want. Or, however, are you the committee to plan parties? Which one are you?



Billie Eilish [00:58:09] Oh, oh, gosh. The committee to plan parties was this was a pretty. 



Jenna [00:58:16] It's pretty good party planning. 



Billie Eilish [00:58:17] Pretty good stuff. 



Jenna [00:58:19] I know. 



Angela [00:58:19] Isn't it interesting, though, that the first time this scene was ever written, it's called the party committee. 



Billie Eilish [00:58:26] The party committee. I know. One of my favorite lines of yours, it's your one off and you're like, Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He's not supposed to just spring things on us willy nilly. And then you just you're like... like the, the hand grab to your face of you crying is just, Oh, it breaks my heart. Angela's whole just like, clearly just like miserable life. 



Angela [00:58:49] Repressed. 



Billie Eilish [00:58:50] Miserable self. And then and like when when you throw the that whole episode. Oh, my God. And the Yankee swap, just like how upset you are that's not going how you wanted it to go. You had a whole idea for how it was supposed to go, and Michael's just ruining everything. And then Dwight kisses Kelly, and you're just. You're just. It's just horrible.



Angela [00:59:11] Furious. 



Jenna [00:59:11] Horrible day for you. And you throw the, the ornaments. 



Angela [00:59:15] Which, by the way, we're supposed to shatter. But they didn't. 



Billie Eilish [00:59:18] They don't shatter. 



Angela [00:59:19] I threw them and they- 



Billie Eilish [00:59:20] That's why it's so funny. 



Angela [00:59:21] I threw it and it bounced right back and I was like trying to stay in character. But at the same time, I'm like, why the hell isn't this breaking? So then, just in a pure rage, I just started screaming and stomping them. And that's what made it in. 



Billie Eilish [00:59:33] No, you guys the characters. Just everybody is Pam, you know? I feel like that's, that's- everyone's Pam, you know? And I, I also love the way that Roy is written because it's so perfectly- he's got charm to him and he's got like, you can see it. But also he's so neglectful and like emotionally abusive that it's like you can totally see how you could get there. 



Angela [00:59:58] My dad had a saying for guys like that. He used to say, Well, Ange, he's not a bad guy, but he's not worth much. And I'm like, That was Roy. 



Jenna [01:00:07] That was Roy. 



Billie Eilish [01:00:08] And just made you feel, like, so shitty, you know? It's it's just like, so, oh, god, it's so good. And it's just like, everything about Pam is just so heartbreaking. And just like you really, you do it perfectly. Everything about it is perfect. 



Jenna [01:00:23] Thank you. 



Angela [01:00:24] Guys. I'm serious. Like this show. It just can't be beat. It just really can't. I like a lot of shows, but it just. It's it's just the one, guys, I'm serious. 



Jenna [01:00:35] We have two things we can do here. If you have any more questions for us, we've asked you all of our questions. So if you have any more questions for us, please ask. Also, we did prepare an office quiz that we would take against each other, and we don't know the answers. We don't know who would win. 



Billie Eilish [01:00:50] Ooh. 



Jenna [01:00:51] Would you like to? 



Angela [01:00:51] By the way. 



Billie Eilish [01:00:52] I would love to do that. 



Jenna [01:00:53] Okay. 



Angela [01:00:53] We haven't seen the questions. We don't know. Cassi prepared them. We haven't gotten to season eight yet. If you ask me a question from season eight, I'm not even going to know because I haven't watched season eight since we filmed it. So that's like. 



Jenna [01:01:03] Okay, so we'll intro the quiz then. We'll say-



Billie Eilish [01:01:06] So here's another interesting thing is that I just every time I watch it all the way through, because again, I start it from the beginning and I finish it every time, I can't believe I do that.  



Jenna [01:01:14] So where are you right now? 



Billie Eilish [01:01:15] I finished it. 



Jenna [01:01:17] You just recently finished it again. 



Billie Eilish [01:01:18] Finished it like a couple weeks ago. Every time I finish it, I take a couple of weeks off and then I start it over. So I'm in my weeks off period, which means it's not right here, it's here.  



Angela [01:01:30] Billie, I'm pretty sure it's just in your DNA now. 



Billie Eilish [01:01:32] I think it is. I think it is. 



Angela [01:01:34] I think. 



Billie Eilish [01:01:34] But for instance, and I think about this all the time, when Rainn came over and did The Office quiz with me, I was watching it, but I hadn't gotten to when Nellie is in the show. 



Angela [01:01:44] Yeah. 



Billie Eilish [01:01:45] And so she wasn't on my mind. I was just not there yet. And so he asked me a question about Nellie. And also I was nervous as shit. Dwight Schrute sitting in front of my face in my parents house and I was 16 like, oh my God, I was so intimidated and nervous that when he asked me a question about Nellie, I just like my brain just didn't work and I just, like, forgot about her character for 2 seconds. And it was so embarrassing.



Angela [01:02:07] And until you said her name, I forgot what Catherine Tate's character's name was. 



Jenna [01:02:09] I really hope there are no Nellie character questions. 



Angela [01:02:13] I completely forgot. 



Jenna [01:02:13] Cuz we haven't gotten there yet. 



Angela [01:02:14] Yeah, okay. Here we go. Here we go. Office quiz with Billie Eilish. 



Cassi [01:02:19] Yes. Starting hopefully from easy questions and it'll get harder. 



Angela [01:02:23] My God, Cassi. How many questions are there? 



Cassi [01:02:26] There's ten. 



Jenna [01:02:26] Is it just is it just anybody shout it out. Whoever's first? 



Cassi [01:02:29] I think so. 



Jenna [01:02:30] But then you said, Cassi, if we shouted at the same time, we each get a point and she has tiebreakers at the end. 



Billie Eilish [01:02:36] Okay. 



Angela [01:02:37] What? I didn't know any of these rules. Okay, here we go. 



Jenna [01:02:39] Oh yeah, sorry. That was a private conversation I had with Cassi. I didn't tell you. 



Cassi [01:02:43]  All right, here we go. What body part did Michael accidentally grill because he liked to-. 



Angela [01:02:49] His foot. 



Billie Eilish [01:02:51] Foot. 



Jenna [01:02:51] Foot. 



Cassi [01:02:51] Angela got it first. 



Jenna [01:02:52] Okay. I didn't realize we could break in before the question was over. 



Billie Eilish [01:02:55] It's true. 



Jenna [01:02:56] See, I'm a rule follower. I was waiting for the end. 



Cassi [01:02:59] It's vicious. 



Angela [01:02:59] I'm slightly competitive. 



Cassi [01:03:01] Number two. Besides the bride, who wore white to Phyllis' wedding? 



Billie Eilish [01:03:07] Kelly. 



All [01:03:07] Oh! 



Cassi [01:03:07] Billie. 



Angela [01:03:07] That was so good. 



Cassi [01:03:11] Okay. Three. What does Michael give Toby as a goodbye present? 



Billie Eilish [01:03:18] A rock? 



Angela [01:03:20] A rock? It's a brick! It's a brick. 



Cassi [01:03:21] Okay, rock. 



Angela [01:03:21] It's a rock. 



Billie Eilish [01:03:22] It was a Post-it note with a rubber band around it. 



Cassi [01:03:27] And what does the Post-it note say? 



Jenna [01:03:30] Suck it? 



Angela [01:03:30] Suck it. 



Billie Eilish [01:03:30] Suck on this, guys. 



Cassi [01:03:31] Suck on this. 



Billie Eilish [01:03:31] Bitch. 



Jenna [01:03:31] Oh my gosh. Suck It is David Wallace's invention. 



Angela [01:03:37] I know. I knew suck was on it. I knew. 



Billie Eilish [01:03:41] Suck on this. 



Angela [01:03:43] Okay. 



Cassi [01:03:44] All right. Who are the members of the Finer Things Club? 



Both [01:03:48] Oscar, Pam,. 



Angela [01:03:50]  Toby. 



Jenna [01:03:52] And Toby. 



Cassi [01:03:52] Angela got it. 



Billie Eilish [01:03:52] I stayed quiet on that one. You guys killed it. 



Cassi [01:03:54] All right, bonus. Who wants to join? 



Angela [01:03:57] Me! Angela! 



Jenna [01:03:57] No! 



Billie Eilish [01:03:58] Andy. 



Jenna [01:03:58] Andy! 



Billie Eilish [01:03:59] Andy. 



Jenna [01:04:00] I think Billie got it. 



Billie Eilish [01:04:01] Literally screaming. 



Angela [01:04:03] I think I just wanted to join in real life. 



Cassi [01:04:05] Aw. Okay. What is Stanley's favorite day? 



All [01:04:09] Pretzel day! 



Cassi [01:04:10] I feel like they all got it. 



Billie Eilish [01:04:11] Yeah. 



Jenna [01:04:12] Okay. Good. Finally. 



Cassi [01:04:14] All right. In Second Life, Dwight creates a character that is exactly like himself in real life. 



Billie Eilish [01:04:19] But he can fly. 



Cassi [01:04:20] But he can fly. 



Billie Eilish [01:04:21] Yeah. 



Cassi [01:04:24] All right. What's the name of the song Jan keeps playing during Dinner Party. 



Jenna [01:04:29] That One Night. 



Angela [01:04:30] Oh One Night. Ugh.



Billie Eilish [01:04:30] I don't know what the name is. They don't ever talk about the name.



Angela [01:04:33] By Hunter. 



Cassi [01:04:34] By Hunter. 



Billie Eilish [01:04:36] (SINGS) That One Night! 



All [01:04:36] Yeah. 



Billie Eilish [01:04:36] But they never talk about the name. Ever.



Jenna [01:04:39] Oh, so maybe it's not called that. 



Billie Eilish [01:04:40] It might not be called that. It's just that's all you hear. 



Angela [01:04:43] She could contest that. That's just the song. 



Jenna [01:04:45] Listen, I don't think my point on that one is going to make any immpact on the final score. 



Billie Eilish [01:04:51] Okay. 



Cassi [01:04:51] Okay. Who is Gabe often mistaken as? 



Billie Eilish [01:04:56] Uh Lincoln. 



Angela [01:04:56] Abraham Lincoln. 



Jenna [01:04:57] Oh, I was going to say a praying mantis. Doesn't someone say that? 



Billie Eilish [01:05:00] A stick bug. They call him (UNINTELLIGIBLE). 



Cassi [01:05:06] All right. This is a fill in the blank question. 



Angela [01:05:09] Oh, gosh. 



Cassi [01:05:10] If Creed can't blank. 



Angela [01:05:12] Scuba! 



Billie Eilish [01:05:12] Scuba. Yeah. Good one. 



Jenna [01:05:14] What's it all been for? 



Cassi [01:05:14] All right, so right now, the score is Billie has six, Angela has four, Jenna has two. 



Billie Eilish [01:05:21] Oh, wow. 



Jenna [01:05:22] So sad. 



Cassi [01:05:22] But I will give you a point for as many names as you can come up with this question. 



Angela [01:05:29] What? 



Cassi [01:05:30] Name Angela Martin's cats. 



Angela [01:05:32] Ember. Ash. Bandit. Lumpy.



Billie Eilish [01:05:34] Sprinkles. Lumpy. Bandit. Garbage. Well, Garbage, I guess she does keep Garbage. 



Jenna [01:05:38] Lady Princess!



Angela [01:05:40] Princess Lady. Princess Lady. Um Ash. 



Billie Eilish [01:05:45] Diane. 



Angela [01:05:46] Diane. 



Billie Eilish [01:05:50] Comstock. 



Cassi [01:05:51] Yeah. 



Angela [01:05:51] Oh, Comstock. 



Billie Eilish [01:05:54] Well, okay, but I don't know how many we did. We both were doing it. It was pretty quick. 



Angela [01:05:58] I said Ember, Ash. 



Billie Eilish [01:05:59] We got Sprinkles, Lumpy, Ember, Ash, Bandit. 



Angela [01:05:59] Princess Lady.

Billie Eilish [01:06:11] We got Garbage. Sprinkles, obviously. 



Jenna [01:06:15] Are there more? 



Billie Eilish [01:06:16] Who are we missing?



Cassi [01:06:16] There's more. 



Jenna [01:06:17] How many more?



Angela [01:06:18] There's like 13, isn't there? 



Cassi [01:06:20] Yeah, there's 14. 



Billie Eilish [01:06:21] Wait, wait, wait.

Billie Eilish [01:06:26] There's ith the one with the. 



Angela [01:06:28] Is there one named Jenny? No. 



Billie Eilish [01:06:31] Does she say them all when, when Dwight is saying that he doesn't like sleeping on? 



Angela [01:06:37] No, she only says, like four. She says Ember, Ash, Lumpy, Diane.



Billie Eilish [01:06:39] Yeah cuz then the other ones...



Angela [01:06:42] Oh, there's some. There's another one I'm thinking of. What letter does it start with? Gimme a letter. 



Billie Eilish [01:06:45]  Wait, wait, wait. Is it the one that's humping Princess Lady that we're forgetting or did we get him? 



Angela [01:06:50] I think that's Mr. Ash. 



Cassi [01:06:51] Yeah, Mr. Ash. 



Billie Eilish [01:06:52] Yeah, yeah, that's right, Mr. Ash. 



Angela [01:06:53] Gimme, gimme one letter that it starts with. 



Cassi [01:06:55] I'll say there are two that start with P.

Angela [01:06:58] Oh, yes. 



Jenna [01:06:58] Two that start with P? 



Cassi [01:07:00] Mm hmm.

Billie Eilish [01:07:05] No. 



Angela [01:07:06] Paul? 



Cassi [01:07:07] No.



Jenna [01:07:09] You're just saying P names. 



Angela [01:07:10] I'm saying like people. 



Jenna [01:07:11] Precious? Oh. 



Billie Eilish [01:07:13] Princess Lady, Diane, Lumpy, Mr. Ash, Bandit.

Billie Eilish [01:07:23] You're just making them up. I can't think of another P one. 



Sam [01:07:28] Hold on, we have a hint. 



Cassi [01:07:30] It's a hint. 



Maggie Baird [01:07:30] You also name your children this. 



Billie Eilish [01:07:36] You name your children this? Like it's a kid name? 



Cassi [01:07:39] Yeah. It's like Angela Martin named her kid after this. 



Angela [01:07:43] Philip! 



Cassi [01:07:43] Yes! 



Jenna [01:07:44] You have a cat named Philip? 



Angela [01:07:46] I didn't realize that. 



Billie Eilish [01:07:47] Oh, because you named him after your cat! 



Jenna [01:07:51] That's right. Because it was named after my grandfather. 



Billie Eilish [01:07:54] But it was named after Angela's cat. Oh that's a tricky one!



Angela [01:07:59] He was named after my cat. 



Jenna [01:08:01] It's after my cat. Oh, my God. That's tricky. 



Angela [01:08:04] Okay. What's our score? What's our tally? 



Cassi [01:08:07] Our score is Jenna, you still only have two points. 



Jenna [01:08:12] What?! I said Garbage! 



Cassi [01:08:13] Okay. Okay. I'll give you one. 



Jenna [01:08:16] No. Fine. This was embarrassing. 



Angela [01:08:17] Fine. You have three points. 



Cassi [01:08:20] Angela, you have seven points. Billie, you have ten points. (APPLAUSE AND CHEERS)
