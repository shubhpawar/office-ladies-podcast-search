OFFICE LADIES | EPISODE 95 - GOLDEN TICKET WITH RAINN WILSON

[00:00:03] Jenna I'm Jenna Fischer.



[00:00:04] Angela And I'm Angela Kinsey.



[00:00:06] Jenna We were on The Office together.



[00:00:07] Angela And we're best friends.



[00:00:08] Jenna And now we're doing the ultimate Office rewatch podcast just for you.



[00:00:12] Angela Each week, we will break down an episode of The Office and give exclusive behind the scenes stories that only two people who were there can tell you.



[00:00:19] Jenna We're the Office Ladies. Hello, everyone.



[00:00:26] Angela Hi.



[00:00:27] Jenna Today is Golden Ticket. Season five, Episode 19. This was written by Mindy Kaling and directed by Randall Einhorn.



[00:00:36] Angela It's a big day for Michael.



[00:00:39] Jenna Oh, it's a big idea for Michael.



[00:00:40] Angela It's a big idea day for Michael.



[00:00:43] Jenna Here's your summary. Michael decides to execute a Willy Wonka themed promotional idea. He is going to take some golden tickets. He's going to hide them in some paper shipments, and any company that finds a golden ticket gets 10 percent off.



[00:01:02] Angela And it's not limited to one.



[00:01:05] Jenna Well, we're going to find that out. Yeah, this idea is going to backfire. He is going to pressure Dwight into taking the fall. But then that backfires.



[00:01:16] Angela Yeah.



[00:01:17] Jenna A lot of ideas and a lot of backfires.



[00:01:20] Angela Lot of layers here. Playing games.



[00:01:23] Jenna Mm hmm. Yeah. Meanwhile, Pam, Jim and Andy are all giving dating advice to Kevin. It's somewhat conflicting. Kevin's a little confused, but he's going to try to make a connection with Lynn from Blood Drive. From their lonely hearts mixer. Lynn is still in the mix from the mixer. Let's get into fast facts. Fast fact number one.



[00:01:50] Jenna This episode contains maybe one of the most famous Office gifs of them all. You know what I'm talking about.



[00:01:59] Angela A jiff or a gif? It doesn't matter. You know the one we're talking about.



[00:02:02] Jenna Is it GIF or jiff?



[00:02:03] Angela I don't know, guys I've never known. I'll never know.



[00:02:07] Jenna Let's ask the two hip young people in the booth.



[00:02:09] Angela Please young people tell us how to say it.



[00:02:11] Cassi I say, jiff, what do you say? No, I say GIF. Sorry.



[00:02:16] Sam I think the correct one is jiff, but it feels wrong. But everyone I know says GIF.



[00:02:22] Cassi It's kind of like gift but you take the T off, so I think it's GIF.



[00:02:24] Angela Well, I've been saying, jiff.



[00:02:28] Jenna I say GIF.



[00:02:29] Angela There you have it. Also, what's a meme? What? What is a meme?



[00:02:34] Jenna A GIF is if it moves and a meme is if it's still.



[00:02:37] Sam It also, I mean, people say jiff is correct, but keep in mind it stands for graphics interchange, whatever the f is. So it starts with a g. So it would be GIF, right? Graphics G.



[00:02:48] Angela Yeah.



[00:02:49] Sam Right?



[00:02:50] Cassi We should put a poll in Office Ladies.



[00:02:50] Angela There it is.



[00:02:51] Angela OK, we'll put a poll. But OK.



[00:02:54] Jenna Jiff is a peanut butter? I'm just saying.



[00:02:57] Angela I like it.



[00:02:59] Jenna You know? I don't know. While you're putting a poll, and since I brought it up are you a crunchy or smooth peanut butter?



[00:03:06] Angela Smooth.



[00:03:07] Jenna Same.



[00:03:07] Angela Get your peanuts out of my peanut butter. So there is a very famous jiff.



[00:03:13] Jenna Or GIF.



[00:03:14] Angela Oh, I said it wrong again.



[00:03:16] Jenna Well, we don't know if you're saying it wrong, lady, but it's true.



[00:03:20] Angela When Dwight looks at camera and has his hand up to his face,



[00:03:23] Jenna it's at the end of the cold open. And he says, it's true. That's everywhere. It even made it to USA Today's ranking of the top 36 GIFs of The Office. It's true was number 13.



[00:03:39] Angela What's number one?



[00:03:40] Jenna Number one-



[00:03:42] Angela That's what she said?



[00:03:43] Jenna No, but that's on the list. But it's not number one. Number one was Michael from the Super Bowl cold open when he says, Oh my God, it's happening!



[00:03:54] Angela Oh OK. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, that's Stress Relief.



[00:03:57] Jenna Stress Relief.



[00:03:58] Angela Yeah, we're there doing the fire drill.



[00:04:00] Jenna Yes. Do you want to know what number two is on their list? Is one of my favorites. It might be my number one.



[00:04:07] Angela Don't throw garbage at my head.



[00:04:09] Angela No, it's Kelly. It is. I have a lot of questions. Number one, how dare you?



[00:04:15] Angela Oh yeah, that's a good one.



[00:04:17] Jenna But I would like to say that number 12 was Jim and Pam's Air High five. We made it on the list, so I'm proud of us.



[00:04:26] Angela I don't know that Angela Martin is on the list with dialog, but I'm on every list if you type in eye roll.



[00:04:32] Jenna You've got an eye roll.



[00:04:33] Angela I've got an eye roll and I've got a real good one in this episode I'm going to point out.



[00:04:37] Jenna Fast fact number two, speaking of the cold open, which gave us this famous GIF, it's all about knock knock jokes. The guys are doing these knock knock jokes with each other, and we'll break it down fully when we get there. So I watched this episode with Lee, and he said, Isn't it amazing how the knock knock joke is so universal that if one person walks up to another person and says, Knock knock, you just know to say, Who's there? And then, you know you're in a knock knock joke. How did that begin? Well.



[00:05:08] Angela Uh oh. Somebody hit the Google button.



[00:05:11] Jenna Yes. As a lady who Googles, I'm going to give you the history of knock knock jokes.



[00:05:16] Angela I want to hear it.



[00:05:17] Jenna So the first written coupling of Knock knock, who's there? The first time it sort of appeared anywhere, people believe is Shakespeare's Macbeth.



[00:05:28] Angela All roads lead back to Shakespeare.



[00:05:30] Jenna That's why it was so important to study it in theater school.



[00:05:33] Angela Hey, I studied Shakespeare.



[00:05:36] Jenna I believe you.



[00:05:36] Angela But I studied it in my writing class.



[00:05:39] Jenna Well, there you go. Act two, Scene three, the porter is very hung over, and he has this monologue where he repeats knock knock, who's there? And then he tells you who's there. He's sort of just kind of in his head.



[00:05:55] Angela Tis I, a Montague.



[00:06:00] Jenna But in this play, it is not a joke. He's not doing like a jokey thing. It's not like what it is now. So now cut to it's the early 1800s. And there's this new kind of comedy on the scene.



[00:06:13] Angela Oh, what kind?



[00:06:14] Jenna It's like a call, answer comedy, or like a bait and response comedy. And here's an example of one of these jokes from the nineteen hundreds. Someone would say, Do you know Arthur? And that would make the other person say, Arthur, who? And then you would say our thermometer.



[00:06:32] Angela Hey-oh!



[00:06:32] Jenna Yes, that was one of the jokes.



[00:06:36] Angela My kids would love that one. Saving it.



[00:06:38] Jenna Well, it's very similar to that whole up dog joke. The what's up, dog? I don't know, what's up with you?



[00:06:45] Angela Right.



[00:06:45] Jenna Right? That Michael famously botched. So then in the mid 1930s, this kind of like pun mania morphed into what is now the traditional knock knock joke. Cartoonist Bob Dunn is credited with inventing this joke in its current form. He wrote a book called Knock Knock Who's There? And it's basically filled with knock knock joke puns. It's sold like two million copies. It took off like crazy. It was a jeopardy question. Get this.



[00:07:21] Angela What?



[00:07:21] Jenna Knock knock jokes were especially huge in Pennsylvania.



[00:07:25] Angela Ohh.



[00:07:26] Jenna Versions of Knock Knock Jokes started appearing in advertisements. The Edgemont Cash and Carry grocery store in Chester, Pennsylvania, ran an ad that said, Knock knock, who's there? Don. Don who? Don forget to do your shopping at the Cash and Carry. Yeah.



[00:07:45] Angela Don forget it.



[00:07:47] Jenna There was also this one. Ready? Knock knock.



[00:07:50] Angela Who's there?



[00:07:50] Jenna Rufus.



[00:07:50] Angela Rufus who?



[00:07:52] Jenna Roof is the most important part of your house. That was a roofing company.



[00:07:57] Angela OK.



[00:07:59] Jenna But politicians started using them. There were like special clubs called Knock Knock Clubs that formed in Illinois and Iowa and Kansas and I guess,



[00:08:11] Angela knock knock clubs?



[00:08:13] Jenna You would just go there



[00:08:14] Angela and tell your knock knock jokes? Come on!



[00:08:15] Jenna Yes, it was like a place to have a drink and share your greatest knock knock jokes. Then in 1936, at like the peak of the knock knock joke craze, there was a song called The Knock Knock Song by Fletcher Henderson, and I'm going to play you a clip.



[00:08:33] Angela Oh my word.



[00:08:37] Fletcher Henderson and others Knock knock. Who's there? Manny. Manny who? Manny manny thanks to you. Who's there? Cecil. Cecil who? Cecil has to use the word wherever she goes.



[00:08:54] Jenna Yeah.



[00:08:54] Angela I love it.



[00:08:55] Jenna A whole song full of knock knock jokes. So then, lady, there is a backlash.



[00:09:02] Angela Oh, people turn on the Knock-Knock.



[00:09:04] Jenna Well, all of these psychologists start coming out like Sigmund Freud and A.A. Brill. They start saying that people who have an incessant need to make puns have a psychological condition.



[00:09:17] Angela Oh no.



[00:09:18] Jenna That it is like a sign of narcissism. A German neurologist named Ottfried Forster said manic punning was a certifiable syndrome, and he actually called it Forster syndrome.



[00:09:33] Angela He named it after himself.



[00:09:35] Jenna I mean.



[00:09:35] Angela Aren't you being a narcissist, Mr Forster?



[00:09:38] Jenna I mean, I don't know.



[00:09:40] Angela You're telling me that people that love and pun are a narcissist and then you name it after yourself?



[00:09:44] Jenna That's right.



[00:09:45] Angela I just want to point that out.



[00:09:46] Jenna Yeah. Well, despite their best efforts, knock knock jokes have stayed around. We still have them today. Of course, they appear in this episode of The Office. Halloween is coming up. That's when I always hear the knock knock jokes. I think. It's like with kids.



[00:10:02] Angela Yeah, what do you got? What do you got?



[00:10:05] Jenna Knock knock.



[00:10:05] Angela Who's there?



[00:10:06] Jenna Boo.



[00:10:06] Angela Boo who?



[00:10:07] Jenna Don't cry. It's just a joke.



[00:10:09] Angela Got it!



[00:10:11] Jenna Do you have any that are like, what are your favorites?



[00:10:13] Angela Well, this is the one I remember from elementary school. Knock knock.



[00:10:17] Jenna Who's there?



[00:10:18] Angela Banana.



[00:10:18] Jenna Banana who?



[00:10:19] Angela Knock knock.



[00:10:20] Jenna Who's there?



[00:10:20] Angela Banana.



[00:10:21] Jenna Banana who?



[00:10:22] Angela Knock knock.



[00:10:22] Jenna Who's there?



[00:10:23] Angela Banana.



[00:10:23] Jenna Banana who?



[00:10:24] Angela Knock knock.



[00:10:24] Jenna Who's there?



[00:10:25] Angela Orange.



[00:10:26] Jenna Orange who?



[00:10:26] Angela Aren't you glad I didn't say banana?



[00:10:28] Jenna I remember that one, too. This is my kid's favorite.



[00:10:32] Angela What?



[00:10:32] Jenna Knock knock.



[00:10:33] Angela Who's there?



[00:10:34] Jenna Interrupting Cow.



[00:10:35] Angela Oh, my kids like this one, too. I know that one interrupting cow-.



[00:10:40] Jenna Moo.



[00:10:40] Angela Aha. Yeah. So the lady has Googled. We have gotten to the bottom of the knock knock joke. What's your fast fact number three?



[00:10:50] Jenna My fast fact number three is that supposedly coming out in November 2021, there is going to be a Michael Scott Funko Pop holding a golden ticket.



[00:11:00] Angela Oh, is it going to be just like Willy Wonka?



[00:11:02] Jenna Yeah, he's going to have a little top hat on. I saw their rendering for it and I don't know how accurate it is, but they're saying this is going to be a new Funko Pop based on this episode.



[00:11:12] Angela Well, that's so fun. I just think they're all so cute. I'm about to get one of Angela and her Fun Run outfit.



[00:11:18] Jenna You know, I don't have a single Pam Funko Pop.



[00:11:20] Angela Come on.



[00:11:21] Jenna I don't have one.



[00:11:22] Angela You got to get one.



[00:11:23] Jenna I guess I do.



[00:11:24] Angela I have one of me and my cat, and now I'm going to have the Fun Run one. But that's so cute. The Willy Wonka one is going to be so cute.



[00:11:32] Jenna Well, if you're into merch from this episode, I also found that you can buy a framable golden ticket, just like the one that Michael is putting in the boxes. It was on Amazon. I don't know why you would want that, but if you do, it is available.



[00:11:46] Angela If you're having a Willy Wonka themed party.



[00:11:49] Jenna Oh yeah.



[00:11:49] Angela Maybe. I was curious. Do you think Michael is being the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka or the Johnny Depp?



[00:11:57] Jenna I think he's Gene Wilder.



[00:11:59] Angela That's what I thought, too. But Gene's blazer is purple, and Johnny Depp's is maroon. And Michaels is maroon.



[00:12:08] Jenna But he's doing all the somersaults and the dialog from the Gene Wilder one.



[00:12:13] Angela I agree. I agree.



[00:12:15] Jenna Those are all my fast facts. We're going to go to a break, and when we come back, we have a delicious surprise. We have a guest.



[00:12:24] Angela Yes. Oh, we can't wait to talk to him. Oh, I gave a little bit away. OK, it's a guy.



[00:12:29] Jenna He's tall.



[00:12:29] Angela And his name is also a weather condition.



[00:12:35] Jenna All right, we'll leave you guessing and then we'll be back. Is someone on the phone.



[00:12:42] Rainn Wilson Hi, it's me, Rainn Wilson.



[00:12:44] Jenna Rainn Wilson!



[00:12:45] Angela Rainn, what are you doing? Where are you calling us?



[00:12:47] Rainn Wilson Well, I just wanted to see how you guys doing. I missed you. I miss you. I just want to know if you want to hang out.



[00:12:54] Angela Oh, I do want to hang out.



[00:12:56] Jenna I would like to hang out.



[00:12:57] Rainn Wilson Great. So when are we getting together?



[00:13:00] Jenna You tell us, you know what we want to do, Rainn, for reals. We had this on the text thread. We want to come to your house and listen to Creed and your son.



[00:13:08] Angela Play the guitar.



[00:13:09] Jenna Play guitar together.



[00:13:10] Angela And I want to see your new place and I want to meet your pigs and your zonkey.



[00:13:14] Rainn Wilson Have you heard about our newest pet sensation?



[00:13:17] Jenna No.



[00:13:17] Angela Oh the Peacock?



[00:13:19] Rainn Wilson We have Alma the Peacock.



[00:13:21] Angela And now Rainn, did she just walk on up or did like, how did Alma get there?



[00:13:26] Rainn Wilson So my wife had a horse for a long time named Gus, and Gus was a very old lipizzan horse, and he passed away this summer. He lived a rich, full horse life, and he died very quickly. So it was that was all fine. But his stall was empty and they put a vase of flowers in there and it was just kind of left empty as a kind of a salute to old Gus. And two weeks later, no joke- and Gus was white, by the way- two weeks later, out of nowhere, sitting in Gus's horse stall was a white peahen, a female peacock.



[00:14:05] Angela Oh my goodness.



[00:14:07] Jenna Whoa.



[00:14:07] Rainn Wilson No one knows where it came from. It had never been seen there previously. It hadn't been seen in the neighborhood or the area of where my wife's horse, where she rides her horses. And it just moved into his stall. And so she kind of trained it to eat feed, and it couldn't stay there because it was spooking some of the horses because it would flap around and squawk. And so she trained it to eat feed and go into a carrying container bin. And we took it to our house and it made the transition perfectly. And you guys, Alma is amazing, and she sleeps during the day when she's not hunting bugs. She sleeps in the olive tree right outside my office window and just stares in at me all day. So if I'm like podcasting or on Zoom calls or whatever, I have a white peacock staring into my office.



[00:15:01] Angela This is all I could ever hope for, Rainn. I'm excited about my hummingbirds. If I had a peacock in my tree, I'd lose it.



[00:15:08] Jenna I mean, Rainn. It's Gus. It's Gus, right?



[00:15:12] Rainn Wilson My friend said if there was ever more proof needed for reincarnation- now I don't know about, I don't know that I buy reincarnation, but I mean, it's it was magical. It's a magical experience. It's it's kind of crazy.



[00:15:26] Jenna Well, there's something happening there.



[00:15:28] Angela I was going to say, whether you believe in reincarnation or not, there's just something beautiful in the universe that happened right there.



[00:15:33] Jenna That's right.



[00:15:33] Rainn Wilson Yeah, yeah. So besides now our pigs that live in our house, now we have a peacock who is very demanding. Holly, my wife, just went crazy. She bought like a big box arrived yesterday and I opened it up and it was filled, I'm not kidding you, it was filled with mealworms.



[00:15:50] Angela Ew.



[00:15:53] Rainn Wilson Two like 20 pound boxes of bags of mealworms. So.



[00:15:57] Jenna Where do you keep those?



[00:15:58] Angela Yeah, do you refrigerate them? Like what? What do you do with the meal? Where do you put a mealworm?



[00:16:04] Rainn Wilson You just put them in on the ground and then she eats the mealworms.



[00:16:08] Angela But in between eating.



[00:16:09] Rainn Wilson Not my wife, the Peacock.



[00:16:11] Angela The peacock.



[00:16:12] Jenna We got that part.



[00:16:13] Angela Well, Rainn. Listen, we're so excited to have you on. We know you've been on before and you've sent in audio clips and you're always so supportive, but we realize there are just some real general questions we ask our guests and we never got to do that with you. And here is the one we always lead with. Are you ready?



[00:16:31] Rainn Wilson OK. Hit me.



[00:16:32] Angela All right. So how did you get your job on The Office? Is it true that you first audition for the role of Michael Scott? Tell us your Office origin story!



[00:16:43] Rainn Wilson Oh, I have a great Office origin story. I love to tell the story. It's fantastic. I was starting to do this show Six Feet Under, and I was just at the very beginning of that of that show. And that was right when HBO was starting to take off, and it was a very widely highly regarded show. And I got cast in this Jeanine Garofalo comedy pilot for ABC. And, you know, it was a very small role, but I was like, Hey, you know, it's an amazing paycheck. This is great. I'm going to be a series regular. It's my first like, real stab at a series regular job and which is a lot better money than doing a guest star just for those who are listening and wondering. And I was very excited about it. Bob Odenkirk was in it. Marc Maron was in it and a really kind of great cast, and I was walking to the table read.



[00:17:37] Angela Wait, wait, wait. Rainn, what was it called? Do you know the name of it?



[00:17:41] Rainn Wilson Oh boy, it'll come to me. I can't remember right now. Oh. Real life, still life? Something like that.



[00:17:48] Angela I'll look it up. Ok go on.



[00:17:50] Rainn Wilson I can't remember. And I was on the way to the table read, which is something that actors you do at the studio or you used to do. You all sit in a room behind a table and you read it out loud and all the executives are there so they can kind of see the cast together, get their energy, hear the rhythms of the read, give notes, etc.. Very common occurrence. On my way there, I ran into this NBC executive that I knew at the time who I had met a couple of times. I don't I forget why. And I was like, Oh, hi. It was Vernon. Vernon Sanders.



[00:18:27] Angela We love Vernon.



[00:18:29] Rainn Wilson Yeah, he's at Amazon now. And a nice guy. And I was like, Hi, Vernon. And he's like, Hi. And it's like, What's going on? He goes, Well, I'm so excited, 'cause we just landed the rights to the BBC Office. And I had seen a couple episodes my friend Sam had recorded from someone in England on a VHS. It was before they were like available in the United States. It's really early on. I had seen them and I just loved them and I, and inside and outside I was like, Oh, that's great. That's great. Inside I was like, Oh, goddammit, I'm going to be on that show. The show, that show's so awesome. Ugh. And so I was like, OK, see, you later. Went to the table read. This was one of the most incredible experiences. In fact, Kent Zbornak  was the producer on it.



[00:19:18] Angela Oh my gosh.



[00:19:19] Jenna Wow. Kent-a-Pedia?



[00:19:21] Rainn Wilson Yeah. So we did the table read and this was an infamous event. We did the table read. It went so bad that the plug was pulled immediately.



[00:19:31] Jenna They canceled it? You didn't even shoot it?



[00:19:34] Rainn Wilson I did not shoot it. They had sets built. We had plane tickets. We had hotel rooms booked. I was supposed to fly the next morning and then start shooting in like two days. And the table read went so poorly.



[00:19:46] Angela We found the name by the way, the name is Slice O'Life.



[00:19:50] Rainn Wilson Slice O'Life. That's what- I knew it had life in it and an S. But so all of a sudden I was free to do The Office. So I called my agent. I was like, I'd really like to audition for this Office. And yes, I was. I was the first person to audition on the very first day. Allison Jones, the casting director, kind of knew me from Six Feet Under and some other things. I was so excited. And I auditioned for both Dwight and Michael on that first day, and she keeps threatening to release my Michael Scott audition. It is truly terrible because I just did a Ricky Gervais impersonation. I didn't know what else to do, so I was kind of pulling on my tie a lot and it was- but Dwight I knew I was like, This is completely in my wheelhouse. I know exactly who this person is. This guy is in my DNA. I have cousins who are really not that different from Dwight Schrute. And the rest is history.



[00:20:51] Jenna We'll Rainn. I remember being paired with you during the screen tests. And they were mixing and matching us. There were like four Pams and four Jims and four Dwights and a few Michaels. Bob Odenkirk was one of the Michaels, which is so crazy because I guess he was available as well since Slice O'Life didn't go forward.



[00:21:13] Angela And Kent Zbornak was available.



[00:21:14] Jenna Yeah, wow. We really-.



[00:21:16] Angela We got a lot of folks from Slice O'Life.



[00:21:18] Jenna We got lucky there.



[00:21:19] Rainn Wilson We scored.



[00:21:21] Jenna But Rainn, I remember being paired with you and I I mean, I couldn't believe it. Of all of us, of all of us, you were 100 percent there from the beginning. I feel like from that moment that I did that first audition scene with you, everybody else, I was like, I was paired with John and I was like, Oh yeah, this is great. And Steve and everybody but Rainn, you were just like, I didn't even know where Rainn began and Dwight ended or Dwight began and Rainn ended. I mean, it was so fluid. It was amazing.



[00:21:58] Rainn Wilson But you were, I have to say, there is a mutual admiration society. For those who don't know, Jenna was totally in Pam. Dressed as Pam. You were reading the book on John Belushi, Wired, that you thought Pam would be reading.



[00:22:12] Jenna It was in the script that she was reading it. So I read the whole novel. I read the whole thing. I was like, my character read it, I'll read it.



[00:22:21] Rainn Wilson Yeah. And but you were a Pam in the waiting room, too. But that was so much fun and we had- I don't know if they'd ever released that audition, but that improvization where I was just sitting, I was kneeling like way too close to you. Which is something I loved to do as Dwight is like he doesn't have an understanding of like personal space.



[00:22:45] Jenna He does not.



[00:22:46] Rainn Wilson He could be talking to someone like four inches away from them. And I always thought that was like, that was really funny. And when I talked about my girlfriend being stationed in Kuwait and um... That was very funny, and you just. And it was such a great improv because most actors feel like, Oh, I'm improvising, I need to talk a lot. You know, they think like, Oh, improvization means talking a lot. And this was an improv where I kind of did this monologue and you just gazed painfully into space, just taking in my body odor and my proximity and the strangeness of my story. And it was it was fantastic. And when we did that, I was like, Oh, I know that we were going to have these parts.



[00:23:30] Jenna Yeah, I felt that way, too. And I felt at that audition, it was very clear to me that you were their choice.



[00:23:37] Angela Did they keep pairing different people with Rainn? Because that's how you know. You know that's the person when they're like, Oh, let's see him with this person and this person and this person.



[00:23:45] Jenna Yeah. And I only got paired with him once, and that made me a little nervous because it was very clear to me that Rainn had the part. And so I was like, Oh, well, I'll pair with him again.



[00:23:56] Rainn Wilson  I remember reading with a lot of different Jim's. And the reason they said ultimately, they went with John, I mean, obviously, he's charming and handsome and funny and great deadpan and smart as hell and likable, but that his size was comparable to mine. There were a couple other Jim's that were like five foot seven, and it just seemed like Dwight would just overpower them. But Jim was actually taller than me, so we kind of like we really matched up kind of energy-wise.



[00:24:28] Jenna That makes sense to me. That does. But then they went a whole other way with your romantic life and they picked the tiniest person in the office.



[00:24:35] Rainn Wilson The tiniest, tiniest little sprig. Yeah. But I didn't think they knew that Dwight and Angela were going to get together. They just were- I don't know where that storyline came from, but I imagine they were just kind of floundering in season two, like, how are we going to mix things up like because at first they had me together with Kelly. They had me kiss Kelly Kapoor.



[00:24:56] Angela But Angela was furious. Angela watched it and was furious. Remember they had me like look in the camera, like they made me look so like they kept saying more anger. More. I was like, Oh my God, my eyes are going to pop out of my head. But I think I think our writers just sat there- Jenna and I have talked about this and we've talked to our writers about it, how they would just take two names and put them on a card and just see what that felt like and sort of spitball a little bit about what those two people would bring out of each other.



[00:25:26] Rainn Wilson Right. And that is one thing that Greg talked about. And I remember, and it's really great lesson for comedy writers and screenwriters, he said a lot of shows really focus on a character and like, Oh, let's make this character really specific and funny and interesting. But he was really about like when these two- two characters going up against each other- that's what she said- then what do-.



[00:25:50] Angela What happens?



[00:25:53] Rainn Wilson 'What happens with that energy? You know, so it was more about he was much more about dynamics between characters. And I think that's one of the successes of The Office.



[00:26:02] Jenna Well, this episode that we're talking about today, Golden Ticket, has a classic Michael/Dwight pairing, and we just I love in this rewatch watching the way that Dwight can be both Michael's lackey and then also like, you can take him to task. You stand up to him. What was that like for you? You were in this comedy duo with Steve Carell for seven years playing out moments like this. What was that experience?



[00:26:36] Rainn Wilson Well, that's a bunch of questions.



[00:26:38] Jenna I know I am, that's how I like to interview people.



[00:26:41] Angela She just likes to throw like 13 big overarching, like huge questions.



[00:26:45] Jenna Like huge thematic questions all at once.



[00:26:49] Rainn Wilson I love it. Well, let's let me hit that one. Let me just say that, you know, when I look back on that work with Steve, I'm just so grateful because he's obviously like one of the greatest actors, comedy actors, but even just actors like ever. And the fact that I got to do so much work with him was just such a gift. I didn't come from an improv background. I was always good at improv, but I went to theater school and I did Shakespeare and I did Eugene O'Neill and I was in New York, kind of off off-Broadway theater guy. And Steve was from Second City and had done years and years and years of improv. So that was his thing. But the thing about Steve that I, you know, they always have this. It's kind of become a cliche like the yes and, you know, like in improv, if you say, like, Hey, you know, I bought a pet peacock. Then you say yes and, and like, Oh, I'd love to see it. Can I feed it, my mealworms or whatever? And Steve was incredible at that, no matter what I did, and I sometimes I would try to go really out of the box, Steve would completely react in character and and accept what was being proposed. So I could just in because obviously we would we would shoot a scene, we would improvise, I mean, we would do the script. We would shoot the script and make sure we got it scripted correctly and then we would improvise. And then sometimes it would just we'd just freely improvise and just go off. And I remember just being like, I couldn't say something like, I decided to open a llama farm just out of nowhere or something. And Steve would just listen as Michael, take that in and be like, Dwight, what are you talking about? Llamas? What? What does that have to do with anything? Why what? You're so weird, Dwight. Go away. You're icky. And it would just be completely in the moment. And I just learned so much from that process. He never got kind of like goddamnit, Rainn, why are you being so weird and so silly, like stay on the point of the scene and we can go way off kilter, you know, way off the path. And he would just be right there all the time. It was really a privilege to work with him.



[00:29:24] Angela I loved it when there'd be a conference room scene, and clearly Michael had an agenda and things to say, and you you, as Dwight of all people would interject, right? And Rainn so many times I go to the script to see if it was written or improvised because I feel like I can tell now and they're always so good. But but it's like seamless. You would never know because of exactly what you just shared. Because Steve, as Michael, no matter what you piped up and said, just like would just take it and run with it. And it was always like an absolute joy. You know me, I'm a nerdy, nerdy improv gal. We've talked on the podcast that you and Jenna had your whole like we did theatah, and Jenna likes to remind me of it Rainn, much like you did. But as like a nerdy improv girl watching you guys it was, it was just awesome. I felt like I had a front row seat of just some really magical moments.



[00:30:23] Rainn Wilson And getting specifically to Golden Ticket, thank you, Angela, and but yeah, I hadn't seen this one since it came out, and it was so fun to watch. And Jenna, just like you said, that dynamic of Dwight being totey lackey suck up just so desperate for Michael's approval and then oddly realizing he's got some power here. And you know, that switch when he's shaking David Wallace's hand and he says, you know, thank you and takes the credit for it. And then Steve's expression of- it was so priceless- of like, Oh, that guy.



[00:31:09] Angela And then your fight in the marketing meeting, like when you get on the phone with the marketing guys, the two of you back and forth with your big ideas.



[00:31:17] Rainn Wilson Yeah, horseboat, and all the toilet, toilet, toilet net. And that- he has a lot of toilet ideas. You don't have ideas. Yes, I do. I would love to see an extended cut of that because I bet that they were a lot more ideas we tossed back and forth in that scene.



[00:31:37] Jenna We should ask Dave Rogers, the keeper of all of the extra footage, because I bet you're right, there had to have been even more. Also, this one was written by Mindy Kaling, and she was amazing at coming up with on the fly in the moment extra stuff to hand you.



[00:31:55] Angela I have to tell you guys in the script, I reread it, Pam tries to butt in with an idea.



[00:32:01] Jenna What?



[00:32:02] Angela Yes. And Michael and Dwight shoot her down. It's the one thing they agree on is that Pam's idea is so stupid. She says- as they're yelling all their ideas, Pam meekly just says, remote control toilets. And they're both like, nah, it's stupid. Doesn't make sense. THat's dumb.



[00:32:21] Rainn Wilson That's great. I wish they would have kept that. That's great.



[00:32:25] Jenna We have another question that we've never asked you, Rainn. This is a popular one we ask all our guests.



[00:32:31] Rainn Wilson OK.



[00:32:32] Jenna Did you take anything from set when the show wrapped?



[00:32:36] Rainn Wilson Oh, this breaks my heart. I should have taken so much more, I should have fleeced NBC Universal. I took Dwight's glasses, I took his little desk plate that said Dwight Schrute on it. I took his stapler. And one or two other things I can't quite remember, I have to look around and see, but I had a whole list of things I gave to Phil Shea and I said, Phil, pull these aside for me and I'll get them from you later. And it was, you know, Dwight's briefcase and this and that and the other thing and blah blah blah. And Phil's like, OK. And then I went back to Phil and he's like, Well, I don't have them or I couldn't get them, I'm sorry, blah blah blah. And then I heard from someone else they were like, Oh, they threatened the crew like to be fired and never work for NBC Universal again if they caught them taking anything from The Office set. And we didn't know why. And then they had that big auction where they auctioned all the stuff off on eBay. You know, even like Dwight's desk was auctioned off.



[00:33:50] Jenna Did you not get your bobblehead?



[00:33:54] Rainn Wilson I got one of the rejected bobbleheads that doesn't look anything like the bobblehead. I did not get my original bobblehead. No.



[00:34:00] Jenna I see. That's a shame.



[00:34:02] Rainn Wilson And I asked Phil Shea for that painting- the Dwight painting is kind of where he's like Chairman Mao.



[00:34:07] Angela Yeah, yeah.



[00:34:09] Rainn Wilson And that didn't happen, either.



[00:34:12] Angela Well, Rainn, you know, you've gone on to do so many awesome things, but we would love to talk to you about your podcast, Metaphysical Milkshake. I listened to a great episode last night when you had Mike Schur on.



[00:34:25] Rainn Wilson Yeah.



[00:34:26] Angela And that was so amazing, just talking about what is good, what is bad, and he sort of like folded in his show The Good Place into that episode. But you and Reza are so thoughtful and you're really asking life's big questions, and it's a great listen.



[00:34:42] Rainn Wilson Yeah, thanks. Well, you guys know this is something that's always been really important to me, and it was kind of the impetus and inspiration for starting Soul Pancake, the digital media company that we we I created with some friends. But this whole idea of life's biggest possible questions has always really intrigued me. You know, I took philosophy in college and I love studying spirituality, and I love psychology and sociology and kind of creativity and how creativity works and why. And so this was kind of the foundation for metaphysical milkshake. Our first season we did on this company called Luminary, but that didn't really work out. So now we're doing a second season, which is available wherever podcasts are, are available and including a lot of the stuff we did for our first season. And it's super fun. We get to talk to just artists and thinkers and writers. We just yesterday interviewed Avi Loeb, who's the head of the Astronomy Division of Harvard University, talking about alien life and discovering extraterrestrial life. And then we had Jason- speaking of Office auctions, Jason Isbell is one of my favorite kind of country rock musicians.



[00:36:02] Angela I love him.



[00:36:04] Rainn Wilson Yeah, he's so great. He came on the show talking about like, what music is, like where does music come from?



[00:36:10] Angela Oh, I need to go listen to that one.



[00:36:11] Rainn Wilson He bought years ago, he bought his wife Dwight's scissors from the NBC auction.



[00:36:19] Angela Oh, wow. Oh my-.



[00:36:23] Rainn Wilson Isn't that crazy?



[00:36:23] Jenna Yes! Well, Rainn, I listened to your interview with Adam Grant where you discussed this concept, what if I'm wrong? And this idea our resistance as people to consider that you might be wrong. Or even what I loved when you guys talked about how, when you know you're wrong, but the cost of admitting you're wrong, that idea of like, there's that social cost. Oh no, if I admit I'm wrong once, people will paint me with a brush that, oh, that's the person who gets things wrong. I mean, it was just it was so thoughtful. I love that kind of introspective discussion that makes me think about things that maybe I wouldn't have thought of otherwise. It's a great podcast.



[00:37:11] Rainn Wilson You know, I'm glad you brought that one up because I feel like this is kind of where our country is. It's very stuck in two sides that are convinced they're 100 percent right and no one's really talking to each other and learning and listening from each other. And when you go to life's biggest questions, these are the questions that we've been asking since the caveman days, since ancient Greece. You know, why are we alive? Do we have free will? What's the meaning of it all? And this is these discussions can unite us, you know? So that's really the whole purpose is to unite people by getting young folks thinking about talking, wrestling with, you know, the human experience.



[00:37:54] Angela Well, Rainn at the end of your podcast with Reza, you guys do this sort of rapid fire of questions. And I love when you ask people, when do you most feel connected to the universe? I'm paraphrasing, but it's something like that question, right? So when do you, Rainn, feel most connected to the universe?



[00:38:14] Rainn Wilson Wow. You're OK, you're you're hitting me with my own, my own weapon. That's what she said. See, that's a profound question, and no one's ever asked me that before. You know, I, you know, so I meditate. That's part of my daily practice. But but I have a new answer to that, which is I've gotten really, really deep into tennis. And we joined a tennis club in this new little town that I moved to in California, and I've been playing a lot, two three times a week. And there's something, really incredible about the game of tennis, because it requires such focus that when you're playing it, you're just completely in the moment. You have to be completely in the moment or you will screw up and hit the ball out. So it forces a kind of like a focus and that allows one to be like connected. When I'm playing tennis, like, time doesn't really exist in the same way that exists in my regular life. My anxieties go away. And I know that's not a terribly profound one, but I have truly been feeling connected to the universe through tennis.



[00:39:36] Angela I think that's great because I think for me, I have to get out of my head sometimes and get in my body. You know, when I get nervous or anxious about something, I stop everything. I put screens away. You know, I love tennis as well, but I like to just get in my body somehow, whether that's a hike or just going on a long walk, just anything to just get back in my body and get out of my head. And I just love that. Rainn, do you remember working on my serve with me on the side of our soundstage? I had my racket and I was telling you I was struggling with my serve. And so we went to the side of the building where the hair and makeup trailers were. And you had you had me work on my toss and then I would hit it onto the side of the building. And I did.



[00:40:24] Rainn Wilson Oh my god.



[00:40:24] Angela And you told me my toss was horrible. It was like all about my toss. My toss wasn't high enough.



[00:40:29] Jenna Did you feel connected to the universe as Rainn told you your toss was horrible, Angela?



[00:40:34] Angela I felt frustrated but connected.



[00:40:38] Rainn Wilson And so funny isn't that funny how it must be old age. I have no memory of that, but that's that's incredible. That's incredible. How is your serve these days?



[00:40:49] Angela You know what it's much better. It's much better. I do toss higher, but I also throw myself at it in a way I didn't before. Maybe it's like being 50 and having, you know, like the past few years of like, just like craziness. I throw myself at that ball in a way I haven't before, and my tennis coach is like, got some power there, Angie. He calls me Angie.



[00:41:11] Rainn Wilson Nice. Wow, fantastic.



[00:41:16] Angela So I'm like, low to the ground Rainn. I've got a good torque.



[00:41:22] Rainn Wilson It's so weird. You guys, what a pleasure being on your show, and thanks for the deep dive and God, what a what an amazing pleasure it was watching Golden Ticket again. That's a really that cold open too, the KGB and the knock knock jokes, it was so good. That's such there's so many classic Office moments throughout it.



[00:41:46] Jenna Rainn, I have to ask, since you brought it up, how did you guys get through that cold open with slapping each other? I mean, because if you broke, you'd have to do it again, and obviously you didn't want to have to keep slapping and getting slapped. But I mean, how'd you do it?



[00:42:02] Rainn Wilson People always ask, like, how do you keep a straight face? It's like, I didn't keep a straight face.



[00:42:06] Angela You didn't, Rainn. You didn't. Because I watched the bloopers and you are one of the top breakers.



[00:42:13] Rainn Wilson I just laughed all the time, especially John and I. We would just make each other laugh. We could look at each other's eyes and know a laugh was coming. So I don't remember, but I am certain that especially that little last section when John was like doing the KGB that I'm sure I was crying with laughter and we had to cut, you know, at least a dozen times.



[00:42:35] Angela I also, I mean, listen, the book end of this is that it starts with the KGB and it ends with the KGB in the tag and you going back and forth with the time when he was like, I'm busy and you're like, What about four forty five? I was like, I know those guys were laughing.



[00:42:53] Rainn Wilson Yeah, I'm sure we can fit you in. Yes. 5:15.



[00:42:56] Jenna Rainn, thank you so much for calling in and chatting with us. We love you. You are our most frequent guest on Office Ladies. That is your title. It belongs to you.



[00:43:10] Rainn Wilson Wow. Wow.



[00:43:10] Angela And we love you Rainn and we love you. We love your heart. We love, you know, you have such a heart for service, Rainn. And I've always admired that about you, and we're just excited for folks to hear Metaphysical Milkshake. And I love it because then it's kind of like, you know, you're in my bathroom with me. No, that's weird. Like, I was listening as I got ready. But you know what I mean?



[00:43:34] Rainn Wilson You guys are the best. Congrats on the success of Office Ladies. I hope it launches an Oprah esque empire for the two of you.



[00:43:42] Jenna Thank you.



[00:43:43] Angela We'll receive that.



[00:43:44] Jenna We love you, Rainn. We'll talk to you soon.



[00:43:47] Angela Take care. I want to come meet Alma.



[00:43:49] Rainn Wilson Yes. Come over and meet the Peacock.



[00:43:51] Jenna We will.



[00:43:52] Angela All right. Bye.



[00:43:54] Rainn Wilson Bye.



[00:44:00] Jenna Bye.



[00:44:00] Angela I just love that fella.



[00:44:01] Jenna I beyond love him.



[00:44:02] Angela I love him. Rainn, thank you so much for stopping by. And now, lady, we got to get into this episode.



[00:44:08] Jenna Let's do it. You know, we've talked a little bit about this cold open already, but we haven't really broken it down. So let's get into it.



[00:44:15] Angela Pam is on the phone. She's trying to give someone like, maybe a fax number. I want to point out at ten seconds, Nick is still in office all day.



[00:44:26] Jenna In the in the note. In the post-it note.



[00:44:30] Angela There's the same Post-it note from last week. It's on the PenStar post-it paper, Nick in office all day. He's still there, folks. So Michael's going to come over and he's messing with Pam. She's trying to give this phone number and he's like fiver, nine three two, like trying to mess her up. She hangs up. She's like, Michael, that makes us look so unprofessional.



[00:44:49] Jenna Yeah.



[00:44:50] Angela Well, he can't wait. He's been there because he has a really good knock knock joke for her.



[00:44:55] Jenna That's right. Knock knock.



[00:44:57] Angela Who's there?



[00:44:58] Jenna Buddha.



[00:44:59] Angela Buddha, who?



[00:45:00] Jenna Buddha this bread for me.



[00:45:03] Angela And then he sits a stick of butter. It's been in his hand. It's not even in the wrapper.



[00:45:08] Jenna I know I'll have, you know, it was not scripted to be unwrapped, but on the day we just thought that would be really funny. And originally, my line in the script, when I look at the butter and the everything on my desk, I was supposed to say, You're making a mess, but I changed it to, there's butter on my desk.



[00:45:27] Angela Yeah.



[00:45:28] Jenna And I thought that was like such a great little find in the moment when we were rehearsing.



[00:45:33] Angela It's very Pam, though. It's like people leave trash on your desk, they throw things at you. It's just a statement. It's like resignation.



[00:45:41] Jenna It is.



[00:45:42] Angela Now there's butter on my desk.



[00:45:43] Jenna Now there's butter on my desk. That's my day today.



[00:45:46] Angela Well, Dwight is super excited about this knock knock joke, and he wants in on the fun.



[00:45:50] Jenna He's got a great one.



[00:45:51] Angela Yeah, and he's like, Michael, please? And Michael doesn't want to hear it. He's like, Please? And I just feel like we got to hear Dwight's knock knock joke.



[00:45:57] Jenna Let's do it.



[00:45:59] Michael Scott No. God.



[00:45:59] Dwight OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me.



[00:46:03] Michael Scott All right.



[00:46:05] Dwight Knock knock.



[00:46:05] Michael Scott Who's there?



[00:46:06] Dwight KGB.



[00:46:07] Michael Scott KG- (SLAP).



[00:46:07] Dwight We will ask the questions!



[00:46:09] Michael Scott What the hell was that?



[00:46:10] Dwight What are you doing?



[00:46:11] Michael Scott What are you doing?



[00:46:12] Dwight Hey, stop it!



[00:46:14] Angela So then they just get in like this slapping fest and then Jim has to get in on it.



[00:46:18] Jenna Yep. Do we need to hear that one?



[00:46:21] Dwight No more knock knock jokes. That's it.



[00:46:23] Jim Ding dong.



[00:46:25] Michael Scott Who's there?



[00:46:25] Jim KGB.



[00:46:28] Michael Scott Dwight, get the door.



[00:46:28] Dwight I'm not answering the door.



[00:46:30] Michael Scott Answer the door.



[00:46:30] Jim Ding dong.



[00:46:30] Dwight No way, it's the KGB.



[00:46:30] Jim Ding dong.



[00:46:32] Dwight I'm not answering that.



[00:46:33] Michael Scott Yes you're going to.



[00:46:33] Dwight You answer it!



[00:46:33] Michael Scott  I'm not going to answer it.



[00:46:34] Dwight I'm not gonna answer it's the KGB!



[00:46:34] Jim (SLAP) The KGB will wait for no one.



[00:46:41] Unidentified It's true.



[00:46:45] Angela It's true.



[00:46:45] Jenna And there's the it's true.



[00:46:46] Angela And there it is.



[00:46:49] Jenna Well, now we're going to start the main plot of this episode. Michael arrives to work dressed as Willy Wonka.



[00:46:57] Angela He's so excited. He points out the jelly beans. What are these? Pam's like jelly beans? He's like, No, they're extra ordinary jellybeans. He's like, so ready for his performance. And he shares that he's put this golden ticket 10 percent off in different boxes of paper and someone's going to get it. And their day is going to be full of whimsy and excitement and fantasy.



[00:47:21] Jenna Here is what the golden ticket says.



[00:47:23] Angela What?



[00:47:25] Jenna This whimsical promotion saves you 10 percent off your total order with Dunder Mifflin Scranton, Pennsylvania. That's what it says. This whimsical promotion. In the conference room, Michael is just like already taking credit for his great idea. It's such a great idea. He needs everyone to come in the conference room and talk about how we need more good ideas like this one.



[00:47:51] Angela He says, and this is like something like people that do this crack me up, he goes, it might be the best idea ever in the history of ideas like, OK, buddy.



[00:48:01] Jenna Here's what I don't understand. He's written on a board, marketing greatness Michael, I didn't get it. It was very amusing to me.



[00:48:11] Angela Well, his job is to profligate great ideas.



[00:48:15] Jenna I guess so.



[00:48:16] Angela He really wants the group, though, to tell them their golden ticket idea. He knows his golden ticket.



[00:48:22] Jenna A golden ticket.



[00:48:22] Angela Yeah. Jim's like, well, we could rent out our trucks. He's like, No Post-it notes, right? Golden Ticket. NASA, lots of golden ticket ideas there. Andy's going to say Golden Girls and a few other things



[00:48:37] Jenna that start with the word golden.



[00:48:38] Angela That start with golden.



[00:48:38] Jenna Golden Grahams.



[00:48:40] Angela Look over his shoulder. Angela Martin one minute, 59 seconds. Major eyeroll at Andy.



[00:48:45] Jenna Angela eye roll.



[00:48:47] Angela Yeah, she thinks Andy's an idiot, guys. She was only engaged to him just two seconds ago, but she's over it.



[00:48:55] Jenna Well, now we're going to move to the kitchen. Andy and Kevin are at the table. Pam and Jim are over by the counter, and Kevin really wants to ask out Lynn. And he's just getting a lot of advice from these guys. Conflicting advice.



[00:49:12] Angela I have two background catches that just delighted me. All right. Number one, these guys are both eating donuts.



[00:49:20] Jenna I noticed that, and I swear to God those are the donuts we got every morning because Kevin's donut is my donut.



[00:49:26] Angela The sprinkles donut.



[00:49:27] Jenna Yes.



[00:49:28] Angela And Andy had the powdered sugar. OK, background catch number two. I love it when our show does this, when it takes an object from a prior episode and pops it back into a new one. Ready?



[00:49:40] Jenna Four minutes? I think I saw it, too.



[00:49:42] Angela Kevin's coffee mug?



[00:49:43] Jenna Yep.



[00:49:44] Angela Kevin's coffee mug is the same mug that Kelly gave to him at her Customer Survey party. You know everyone's face in the big star. But what about Andy's mug? Andy's mug is the same one from Moroccan Christmas, and it was featured in the deleted scene I talked about when Jim and Pam decide to shop within the office for Christmas for each other because they're so broke. Jim goes up to Andy and asks him about his mug, and it's in the bloopers. It was also in the script. Two coffee mugs from two prior episodes. I love that.



[00:50:16] Jenna Well, later in this episode, if you look at Oscar's desk, he's going to have his America's Got Talent mug, too.



[00:50:22] Angela I love it. Well, this whole Kevin and Andy and Jim and Pam storyline was much bigger in the actual shooting draft, and there are few deleted scenes and things I want to share. First of all, this is the scene that would have set up this whole storyline. It's at the beginning of the day and they're getting in the elevator. Kevin, Jim and Pam, and who rushes in at the last minute because she works in the Scranton business park, but Lynn. Can we hear it?



[00:50:49] Lynn Hold the door please! Hi Kevin.



[00:50:49] Kevin Hey, Lynn.



[00:50:49] Lynn Did you get my message?



[00:50:49] Kevin Um, yeah. I've been really busy.



[00:51:03] Lynn Oh. It's OK.



[00:51:06] Kevin Yeah, I'm probably going to be busy for the next 20 days or so. So, yeah.



[00:51:16] Lynn Bye.



[00:51:19] Jim You're going to be busy for the next 20 days or so?



[00:51:22] Pam I thought you liked Lynn.



[00:51:23] Kevin I do like Lynn. That's what Andy told me to say.



[00:51:27] Jenna Aha!



[00:51:29] Angela Right?



[00:51:30] Jenna So Jim and Pam are learning that Andy has been giving Kevin some pretty bad advice.



[00:51:36] Angela Yeah, he likes Lynn, but tells her, you know, he didn't return her messages and he's going to be busy for 20 days?



[00:51:43] Jenna Wow, that's amazing.



[00:51:46] Angela Jim and Pam can't let Andy do this to Kevin, so they start giving him advice, right? Just ask her out. And in the deleted scenes, you really get a sneak peek into where Andy's brain is at. You got to hear this talking head.



[00:52:01] Andy I was raised to be a gentleman around women. But when your fiancee is Satan, that doesn't work. So I have some new ideas and new techniques, and I'm trying them out. Kevin Malone is my guinea pig.



[00:52:14] Jenna Oh man, I wish that had stayed in.



[00:52:16] Angela Doesn't that explain it all?



[00:52:18] Jenna It does. I mean, I think I was able to realize that the reason that Andy is being this way is because he's still reeling from his breakup with Angela. But that really would have been great.



[00:52:30] Angela I know, because I mean, I don't think Andy's a bad guy, but he's clearly hurt and acting out and using poor Kevin.



[00:52:38] Jenna Well, listen, Jim's going to get a phone call now. Guess what?



[00:52:43] Angela What?



[00:52:43] Jenna His client Tom has found a golden ticket.



[00:52:47] Angela Tom from Blue Cross of Pennsylvania.



[00:52:49] Jenna Our biggest client.



[00:52:52] Angela Uh oh.



[00:52:52] Jenna Oscar, how much is that going to cost us? Michael wants to know.



[00:52:56] Angela It's going to hurt a bit.



[00:52:58] Jenna Well, what about this? Guys, Tom found all five golden tickets.



[00:53:03] Angela Holy moly!



[00:53:05] Jenna Did they say one per customer?



[00:53:08] Angela Nope.



[00:53:08] Jenna Nope. Our biggest client just got 50 percent off their total order with us.



[00:53:14] Angela I mean, this is a huge win. Talk about winning the golden ticket.



[00:53:18] Jenna He sure, he won all the golden tickets.



[00:53:19] Angela He won all of them. This have made me think Jenna. Have you ever won like a really big ticket item?



[00:53:27] Jenna I don't think so.



[00:53:29] Angela I called my mom because I know my aunt Anne has won things like she signs up for, you know, raffles and things, and she's won trips.



[00:53:38] Jenna Really?



[00:53:38] Angela Yeah, she's super lucky. And I was like, Mom doesn't Aunt Anne win a lot of things and she said, Well, you know, your dad won a very big ticket item.



[00:53:46] Jenna What did your dad win?



[00:53:48] Angela And I was like, Mom, what are you talking about? And she said, Well, this was before you were born. And Jenna, the story just delighted me so much. One because, you know, my dad's passed away and so any new information because, you know, you play every memory, you look at everything but anything that you hear about someone you loved who's no longer with you, you just, it's like this beautiful, wonderful thing. So my mom said, Oh yeah, before you were born, we had just moved to Lafayette, Louisiana and the school was having a fundraiser and they were raffling off a brand new pink station wagon.



[00:54:25] Jenna What?



[00:54:26] Angela She said it had a cream white top. And your dad went and donated some money and signed up and he won the car.



[00:54:35] Jenna Your dad won a pink station wagon?



[00:54:37] Angela Yes! And she said, and it was a very good car and we drove it for a long time.



[00:54:42] Jenna Do any of your sisters remember this car?



[00:54:45] Angela My sister, Billie said she remembers it, but I was like, Oh my goodness, my mom's like, I know we have a picture somewhere. I said, Mom, please, I have to see it. And she said, Oh, Ange, your dad was so tickled that he won that car. He was so excited. And she said, and it was a light pink with a cream top. And they drove it around for years.



[00:55:08] Jenna I love that story.



[00:55:11] Angela I know! It made my day.



[00:55:12] Jenna You know, I have been pitching for years a documentary series that I call Little Winners, and it is all about people who have won, not the lottery, but raffles. And they get something like this car or like a new recliner or like a trip. Right? And how did it affect their life? Little Winners. No one will buy it from me. No one wants to make it. I pitch it all the time. Why will no one make Little Winners?



[00:55:45] Angela I love Little Winners. Well you do it as a podcast and have the winner on and they could tell us all about it. Here's the thing. You know, I like to think about my parents. They were young parents. They had three young girls at this time. And what that car meant to them. And then I also think about the car dealer there in Lafayette, Louisiana, and how the school- probably the superintendent was buddies with the guy at the dealership and was like, What do you got that we can raffle off? And he's like, Well, that pink station wagon? No one wants it.



[00:56:14] Jenna I can't move it.



[00:56:15] Angela We can't sell it.



[00:56:17] Jenna It's a write off. I'll give it to you. Amazing.



[00:56:24] Angela So Michael is spiraling out, though, because he's realizing Blue Cross from Pennsylvania getting this many golden tickets, he's going to get fired.



[00:56:33] Jenna And Jim is upset, too, because that's his commission.



[00:56:37] Angela Oh, right.



[00:56:37] Jenna Right? So Michael is going to storm down to the warehouse. I love the beginning of this scene.



[00:56:43] Angela This scene is brilliant. He goes barreling in going, Hey, hey, hey, you idiot to Darryl.



[00:56:49] Jenna And Darryl says, Start over.



[00:56:52] Angela So good. I was like, I'm keeping that. I am keeping that. The next time one of the kids has a moment where they're sourcing me, I'm going to be like, Start over.



[00:57:01] Jenna Exactly. Then Michael comes back with, sir. That was all in the script. I looked that up. I had to know.



[00:57:09] Angela So did I. So did I. Michael's like, Darryl, how could this happen? How could this happen? And he says, I put three pallets on the truck for Blue Cross every week. Where were you putting the boxes? Were they near each other? And Michael's like, I need to ask you something. I need you to be honest with me. What is a pallet?



[00:57:28] Jenna So good, so good. David Wallace is not happy. He calls. Pam takes the call. But Michael is sort of sneaking out of his office. He's taken off his Willy Wonka outfit.



[00:57:41] Angela Yeah, he's getting rid of the evidence.



[00:57:43] Jenna Yes, he's like, Do not. I am not here. I am not here. So Pam has to say that he's at a civil rights rally at the Lincoln Memorial.



[00:57:51] Angela Which I want to point out is in Washington.



[00:57:53] Jenna Yeah, he's gone to Washington, D.C., I guess.



[00:57:57] Angela In the same day, he's going to go to a civil rights movement in Washington, D.C., and get a colonoscopy in Scranton.



[00:58:03] Jenna Exactly. Well, Michael tosses his Willy Wonka costume into a dumpster. He's now wearing a Pioneer's football shirt. Ange, I had to look this up. This is a minor league football team from Wilkes-Barre Scranton that played in the AF2, and they had a really strong season in 2009 when we shot this episode. It's kind of like perfect that he's wearing the shirt because they only ended up losing two of their games that year. They made it to the playoffs. Then they made it all the way to the Arena Cup, which is like the Super Bowl of AF2 football. They ended up losing, but it was like a great, great season for them. They were kind of on a roll. Their previous season had been good as well.



[00:58:50] Angela I love it.



[00:58:52] Jenna I love every time we have.



[00:58:53] Angela Every single time.



[00:58:54] Jenna These local references on the show in ways that don't even get mentioned.



[00:58:59] Angela Right.



[00:59:00] Jenna We never even mentioned the shirt, but there it is, just creating specificity.



[00:59:06] Angela I love it. Michael is going to make an announcement. Everyone to the conference room. A lot of announcements in this episode. A lot of announcements. He's really, I think, just trying to find a way out. He says he has a big net where he takes all of their subconscious ideas and tries to turn them into something. And Michael's like, guys, guys, they're not going to fire us. We're fine. And Oscar's like, what do you call shutting down a branch?



[00:59:31] Jenna And then Michael says someone needs to come up with a golden ticket idea to get them out of this mess. You know? And Pam says, Do you mean an idea that blows up in our faces later? That kind of idea?



[00:59:44] Angela That's some Pam sass.



[00:59:45] Jenna That is some Pam sass. So while Michael's up at the top of the conference room, he's wearing a suit jacket and I'm thinking, where did that come from? Because the last time we saw him, he was at the dumpster in his Pioneers football shirt.



[00:59:57] Angela Right.



[00:59:57] Jenna I looked it up. It's Andy's jacket. He's wearing Andy's jacket, and there was a bit at the top of this scene that got cut where as they're entering the room, Michael says, Andy, give me your jacket. You can do something for me. I want your jacket. So that is why he's now wearing this odd jacket over his football shirt.



[01:00:16] Angela Well, he's got to still look like the boss.



[01:00:19] Jenna The phone's going to ring now.



[01:00:20] Angela Not good.



[01:00:21] Jenna It's David Wallace. Pam says Michael's having a colonoscopy. I'm not sure that David Wallace believes it.



[01:00:30] Angela You think? Because he was just in Washington. Michael gets on the phone with him and literally is reading off the procedure of how you give a colonoscopy off his computer.



[01:00:43] Jenna It's pretty amazing. But now it is clear. David Wallace says the company is going to lose a lot of money. How did you let this happen? Whose idea was it?



[01:00:55] Angela Someone's got to pay for this terrible idea. Michael tells David Wallace it was Dwight. Just so devious.



[01:01:03] Jenna I know.



[01:01:04] Angela Oh, Michael,



[01:01:06] Jenna Well it's like David Wallace is just naming people. And he says, Was it Dwight? And Michael's like... Yes.



[01:01:14] Angela Well, now Michael has got to convince Dwight to take the fall for him.



[01:01:18] Jenna Mm hmm. And so he's going to get out his diary and he's going to say, Dwight, I wrote it down that it was your idea. He's trying to convince Dwight that Dwight is remembering wrong. What happened this morning.



[01:01:31] Angela And now, you know, Dwight runs to get his diary. It's like the dueling diaries where they're going back and forth. Michael realizes he's not making any headway with this whole diary business, so he says, Would you like to go out to lunch with me? Just the two of us? And Dwight says, with all my heart. This scene continues in the script, Jenna. So after Dwight says, with all my heart, he says, but I already ate lunch. And Michael says it's 11 a.m. Dwight says, as a farmer, I eat breakfast at 4:30. At 10:00, I'm famished for lunch. If you wait three hours, we can have supper. Maybe. Michael says, No, no, no. How about we do something else you like. Jenna, did you notice there are no scenes of them at the restaurant? They're supposedly going to have lunch, right, because in the episode, Michael says, go have lunch. We don't know that Dwight's already eaten, all of that's been cut out. And then the remainder of their scenes, they're on the side of the road.



[01:02:28] Jenna They're taking a walk.



[01:02:29] Angela Well, here is a scene that was in the deleted scenes that I just love so much. Of all the things that Dwight would want to do, guess what he loves to do?



[01:02:38] Jenna Go for walks?



[01:02:40] Angela Oh lady, no. He likes a stroll.



[01:02:44] Michael Scott Are you still taking those strolls that you like to take?



[01:02:47] Dwight Thrice weekly.



[01:02:48] Michael Scott OK, let's go take a stroll together.



[01:02:51] Dwight I thought you said my strolls were silly.



[01:02:52] Michael Scott No, just cause you can't call them walks.



[01:02:55] Dwight You really want to stroll?



[01:02:55] Michael Scott Yes.



[01:02:57] Dwight You wanna power stroll or just a regular stroll?



[01:03:00] Michael Scott you call it.



[01:03:00] Dwight Power stroll.



[01:03:03] Michael Scott OK.



[01:03:04] Dwight You wearing sunblock?



[01:03:05] Michael Scott Yes.



[01:03:05] Dwight What SPF?



[01:03:06] Michael Scott One.



[01:03:07] Dwight That's like water. I'll grab my tube.



[01:03:10] Michael Scott OK.



[01:03:12] Angela Oh, he loves a stroll. Clearly, it's like a whole thing with him and Michael about calling it a stroll or a walk. Then there's another scene where they're down in the lobby and Hank is there, and Dwight is putting sunscreen on Michael's face, and Hank looks up and deadpan says, you found somebody to go on a stroll. And Dwight goes, I did, and Hank goes, nice.



[01:03:37] Jenna This is amazing because we got a ton of mail because people were pointing out Dwight's shoes in the scene when he is walking, a.k.a. strolling with Michael. Tons of people said, Why does Dwight have on very white, very non Dwight trainers? Like, Where did these come from? And I looked in the script and it says, Michael and Dwight are walking. Dwight is wearing sneakers and walks with his hands clasped behind his back. That was like a script note, but I'm sure it was all based on this back story that Dwight strolls three times a week. He's got his sunblock, he's got his shoes.



[01:04:18] Angela He probably has a little bag he takes to work. Clearly, Hank knows how much Dwight loves a stroll and how he's been looking for a stroll buddy.



[01:04:25] Jenna I love it. I love it.



[01:04:28] Angela I know it tickled me.



[01:04:30] Jenna Well, this stroll is not going to convince Dwight. Dwight says, I am not going to fall on my sword for you. It's not going to happen.



[01:04:37] Angela He's done it before. He's fallen on his sword and it wasn't pleasant.



[01:04:40] Jenna It wasn't.



[01:04:41] Angela Michael makes a pretty big speech to Dwight. He's like, Listen, why would you want to stay here? You're cooped up. You're not even dating Angela anymore.



[01:04:49] Jenna You have a whole farm.



[01:04:50] Angela Yeah. And he says, you know, on the other hand, I would be lost without Dunder Mifflin.



[01:04:56] Jenna And Dwight says, What about Shoe La La, Michael? This is a Mindy Kaling thing, for sure. This has Mindy Kaling written all over it.



[01:05:06] Angela And then Michael has a talking head where he says, I have an idea for a fancy men's shoe store called Shoe La-La. And it's just men's shoes for the special occasions in a man's life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby or just for lounging around the house.



[01:05:21] Jenna Yeah, well, we got some mail from Kayla G, who said, I just want to let you ladies know that Michael seems to have gotten Shoe La La up and running and Nelson, British Columbia. And I looked it up  and sure enough, there is a Shoe La La. According to their website, they are a boutique shoe store offering exquisite leather footwear and handbags from all over the world. They are a family run business that has been around since 1983.



[01:05:51] Angela Well, I want you guys to know that there is a Shoe La La in Lafayette, Louisiana.



[01:05:57] Jenna I saw that too.



[01:05:59] Angela My town where I was born, Lafayette. And you know what? I love the slogan for their shoe store. If you go on their website, it's a clothing boutique and shoes. But their slogan is "Life is short. Buy the damn shoes."



[01:06:14] Jenna That is amazing. So there are two Shoe La La's, Michael, but none of them seem to sell men's shoes.



[01:06:20] Angela Oh, well, I would love nothing more for Michael to have Shoe La La. Well, we have a great reverse talking head.



[01:06:30] Jenna Yes, I noticed.



[01:06:31] Angela So Dwight is in Michael's chair and you pull back to reveal Michael perched behind him. Basically in this talking head Michael's like, he's going to do it for me. He's going to do it. He's going to take the fall. And Dwight's like, no, I haven't decided. Well, folks in the office are starting to catch on. They get it. They know what Michael's doing. He wants Dwight to take the fall and they start gossiping about it. There's a scene in the kitchen, you guys, that was deleted where Meredith, Kelly and Angela and Oscar are all being real chatty. And Michael walks in and overhears a bit, and he's spying on them from the bathroom. Let's hear it.



[01:07:09] Dwight Ladies.



[01:07:11] Oscar Really? That's.



[01:07:13] Kelly I hope Dwight gets fired and we get a hot new guy to replace him.



[01:07:15] Oscar Seriously.



[01:07:16] Meredith What if it's a hot new girl?



[01:07:18] Kelly Oh my god, I had not thought of that.



[01:07:19] Angela Martin I think it's horrible what Michael is doing, really. I mean, this is unacceptable behavior.



[01:07:30] Michael Scott Hey, did you notice that our bathroom is right next to our kitchen? How's that up to code? I don't know.



[01:07:42] Angela Martin This is not fair what he's doing to Dwight.



[01:07:44] Meredith Of course you think that. You used to bone the guy.



[01:07:46] Oscar  I think men bone women. I hate that I'm correcting that.



[01:07:49] Angela Martin All I'm saying is that Dwight can't take the blame for this. It has to land on Michael. It's time for a reckoning.



[01:07:55] Oscar It's true.



[01:07:56] Jenna OK. These are the kind of slice of life, slice o life!



[01:08:01] Angela Slice o life. You brought it back.



[01:08:03] Jenna These are the kind of slice of life office moments that I love so much, just the scuttlebutt.



[01:08:10] Angela There's so much going on,



[01:08:11] Jenna just the gossip and the opinions, you know?



[01:08:14] Angela I loved this scene. And Michael overhears it, you guys. And there's a whole scene where Michael confronts everyone and he really lets em have it. He goes barging into the bullpen and he's like, Hey, everyone, I need to make an announcement. And Jim is like, This is a new record. And Michael goes, That's because I have a lot to say today, James. He's ticked off. And then he goes around the room and he's like, yells to the room, have you wondered what it would be like if I was fired? And everyone super happy raises their hand. And Michael's like, damn it. I didn't ask for a show of hands. If I get fired and corporate brings in new leadership, you have no idea who might come. And then he starts singling people out. He says, You have no idea how bad it could get. Maybe it would be someone who knows that we don't actually need three accountants.



[01:09:11] Jenna I remember shooting this scene now.



[01:09:12] Angela Yes, it's in the deleted scenes.



[01:09:15] Angela Then it looks right at Jim and Pam and he says, or lets couples work together without sending them to different branches. And then he has this moment and it made me laugh. He goes, So you didn't think about that, huh? So let's just bite our tongues instead of saying mean things about me when I pretend to be pooping in the bathroom, OK? But it was a long speech, and he really just lets them all have it.



[01:09:41] Jenna I love this episode so much. I think Steve Carell just is brilliant in this episode. He's playing so many different things. We already talked about this with Rainn, but I just absolutely love the Michael/ Dwight dynamic. I really loved this one.



[01:09:56] Angela I did, too. And this was like one of those sleeper ones that we hadn't seen in forever. And we're like, Oh my gosh, Golden Ticket.



[01:10:02] Jenna I agree. Golden Ticket is a golden ticket. Well, now David Wallace is going to show up.



[01:10:06] Angela He drove from New York, you guys.



[01:10:08] Jenna Yeah. David Wallace arrives at the office, right? This is a serious thing. He goes into Michael's office with Dwight.



[01:10:17] Angela You could hear a pin drop.



[01:10:19] Jenna And he turns to Dwight and he says, Dwight, I owe you an apology. Blue Cross was so excited about the golden ticket promotion that they have made Dunder Mifflin their exclusive provider for all office supplies.



[01:10:33] Angela Huge, this is huge.



[01:10:35] Jenna And he puts his hand out to shake Dwight's hand.



[01:10:38] Angela Michael is about to split in half. He's looking at Dwight like you better let him know what was my idea.



[01:10:45] Jenna And Dwight shakes his hand.



[01:10:46] Angela And says, Thank you, David. And now all the power has been flipped.



[01:10:51] Jenna Amazing, amazing writing. They go out into the bullpen. Wallace tells everybody.



[01:10:58] Angela Dwight gets this victory lap. Pam hugs him.



[01:11:01] Jenna I loved doing that. I loved it.



[01:11:03] Angela And then Creed's like, way to go, kid.



[01:11:06] Jenna I know. Creed is like, Sure, it was Dwight. Jim is giving Dwight credit, and they are all watching Michael squirm.



[01:11:14] Angela And then David's like, You know what, Dwight? You need to talk to the marketing guys in New York. In corporate.



[01:11:19] Jenna We want to hear more of your ideas, more of your brilliance.



[01:11:22] Angela Pam, can you set up that call? And Michael's like, I could be in there and he's like, No, no, no, no, no. You got things to do. Come on, Dwight.



[01:11:28] Jenna Being in that conference room for that phone call was a delight. This was one of my favorite things to do. We've talked about this. I loved taking notes during these comedic scenes. And, you know, pretty soon, Pam isn't going to be the receptionist anymore.



[01:11:43] Angela I know.



[01:11:44] Jenna And this was the part of the job that I miss the most.



[01:11:48] Angela Getting to be in these ridiculous situations with Michael.



[01:11:51] Jenna Being the note taker. Because they're on the phone and Dwight is just saying ridiculous stuff. And of course, Michael bursts in.



[01:11:59] Angela Right, because it's really clear that Dwight doesn't know anything about Willy Wonka.



[01:12:03] Jenna No. And callback. Callback to a deleted scene, but that we love, the toilet buddy.



[01:12:09] Angela That's right, this is a deleted scene from Job Fair. Remember, Michael comes out of the bathroom flustered because all the contents of his pockets fell into the toilet. And then he threw his cell phone in the toilet out of anger. And he says, then, that he had this brilliant idea about this mesh toilet guard cover. Now Jenna in the episode, Michael calls it the toilet buddy. But in the shooting draft, it was called the toilet guard. And I think in the moment Steve called it toilet buddy, because then he corrects himself as Michael, he goes previously known as the toilet guard. So I think that's just Steve staying in the moment but catching that he had flubbed a line.



[01:12:53] Jenna And then Dwight mentions his idea called Horse Boat, which I love Horse Boat. You can go from riding to just being on the water. And then Michael hits back with Toilet Sponge. I don't know what that was.



[01:13:09] Angela It's more absorbent. The toilet sponge. It's more absorbent.



[01:13:13] Jenna So it's a toilet that's a sponge?



[01:13:15] Angela No, I think it's a sponge for your bum. I don't know. It doesn't say. He just says,.



[01:13:19] Jenna We're not sure.



[01:13:20] Angela He says it's more absorbent. That's what he says.



[01:13:23] Jenna Now, lady, in this back and forth, this brought up a product that my friend Stacey and I invented in high school that we thought we were convinced was our ticket to being millionaires.



[01:13:35] Angela What?



[01:13:36] Jenna It's called the tan baster. You know, that thing that you wash your dishes with that you fill up with dish soap and it has little sponge at the end.



[01:13:44] Angela Yes.



[01:13:44] Jenna The tan baster is very similar, Angela. It has a little sponge on the end, but it's filled with sunblock and you just baste it on yourself and your hands stay clean. The tan baster.



[01:13:59] Angela Or you could get spray.



[01:14:01] Jenna Well spray wasn't around yet Angela. It hadn't been invented yet. You see how we can go nowhere with the tan baster but at the time,



[01:14:09] Angela it could have been.



[01:14:10] Jenna There was a need. And clearly the spray has filled the need. But.



[01:14:14] Angela And the stick, I love me a, you know, sunscreen stick.



[01:14:18] Jenna Yeah Ange, I get it. There's a lot of solutions today, but I'm taking you back to the 1990s when none of these things existed, except for goopy sunblock and we were solving a problem. Also, we had the whole like television commercial, the whole infomercial in our head, because you know who else could use it? Maybe older people who need to apply, you know, lotions because they have arthritis.



[01:14:46] Angela Right. Or maybe they've lost range of motion and they can't reach some places.



[01:14:50] Jenna Well, that was the other great thing about the tan baster. It was like a back scratcher. It could go down your back. See? Tan baster.



[01:14:58] Angela I think the name was part of the problem.



[01:15:01] Jenna Why?



[01:15:01] Angela Because every time you say tan baster, I just think of a turkey on Thanksgiving. Brown and crinkly with gravy.



[01:15:11] Jenna Let me take you back to the 1990s. This was again before we kind of knew about sun damage so much.



[01:15:18] Angela No, no, no. No. Because you based a turkey.



[01:15:20] Jenna I know and you baste your body. You're going to get nice and tan if you use the tan baster. You know, I'm saying this is when people wanted that. They weren't into sunblock for the SPF.



[01:15:31] Angela Right.



[01:15:32] Jenna Right. This is when you were still basically applying baby oil to yourself and sitting in the sun.



[01:15:35] Angela With iodine.



[01:15:35] Jenna Yeah, right.I don't know. I'm just saying.



[01:15:39] Angela OK, well, very passionate.



[01:15:42] Jenna Toilet buddy, the tan baster. Stacy, I'm sorry. We never got it off the ground. Oh, well.



[01:15:51] Angela Stacy, somewhere you guys have a sketch of the tan baster, and I'd love to see it.



[01:15:56] Jenna We do have a sketch of the tan baster. You know, I've been trying to work that tan baster into a lot of projects for you and I.



[01:16:03] Angela Lady, we're not going to have an Office Ladies tan baster. It's just not happening.



[01:16:09] Jenna OK.



[01:16:10] Angela You know what I want? Before we do a tan baster I want a rosé, OK? I think more of us would use the rosé.



[01:16:17] Jenna Let's put a poll out there. What do you want more, an Office Ladies rosé or Office Ladies tan baster?



[01:16:24] Sam I got to go with tan baster.



[01:16:27] Angela I knew you were going to say it, Sam, I knew it.



[01:16:28] Sam Why did you think I was gonna say it?



[01:16:29] Angela Novelty.



[01:16:30] Sam No, because a lot of the sprays and sticks have harmful chemicals in them, like aerosols and things that are bad for you. Cassi?



[01:16:37] Cassi I'm team rosé.



[01:16:39] Angela Yay!



[01:16:40] Cassi Always down to try wine. Well.



[01:16:44] Angela You know what? Let's drink rosé while we baste ourselves.



[01:16:46] Sam Is it possible to baste rosé into my mouth?



[01:16:48] Angela Hey!



[01:16:50] Both A rose baster.



[01:16:51] Jenna Perhaps.



[01:16:54] Angela Oh my word, where are we? Oh, you guys, we got to check back in with Kevin and Lynn.



[01:16:59] Jenna We do, because poor Kevin has been receiving a lot of advice this whole episode. And guess what? When he finally does meet up with Lynn in the parking lot, he does just fine being Kevin.



[01:17:14] Angela He says, I'm just going to say everything I'm thinking. She has a great smile. He'd like to take her for dinner and a movie. She says, yes, he's happy. And then he says, boobs.



[01:17:30] Jenna And she's delighted.



[01:17:31] Angela Yeah.



[01:17:32] Jenna Lynn just likes Kevin.



[01:17:35] Angela Yeah.



[01:17:36] Jenna Like you said, there's a lid for every pot.



[01:17:39] Angela There is. Dwight's advice to Kevin was just go be alive next to her.



[01:17:46] Jenna Well it worked. And finally, we have our tag. A final knock knock joke. A ding dong joke, really.



[01:17:54] Angela Yeah, we talked about this with Rainn. This one is so hilarious because Dwight thinks he's going to get Jim back. And he does ding dong and then Jim's like, You know what? I just got out of the shower. I need one second. And then, like we talked about, they go back and forth with like, Well, I can come back, when's good for you? It's like, so ridiculous. And that is Golden Ticket.



[01:18:15] Jenna We hope you enjoyed. I loved this episode.



[01:18:17] Angela I did, too.



[01:18:19] Jenna And thank you, Rainn Wilson for coming on our podcast. That just gave me all the warm fuzzies for the whole day.

[01:18:38] Jenna We are. You know, you told us sometime after Labor Day. Well, it's after Labor Day.



[01:18:43] Angela Guess who remembered the date you told her.
