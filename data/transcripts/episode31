OFFICE LADIES | EPISODE 31 - THE COUP

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:04] I'm Jenna Fischer.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:05] I'm Angela Kinsey.

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:06] We were on "The Office" together.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:07] And we're best friends.

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:08] And now we're doing the ultimate "Office" rewatch podcast just for you.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:12] Each week we will break down an episode of "The Office" and give exclusive behind the scenes stories that only two people who were there can tell you.

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:19] We're the "Office Ladies". Are you ready for some conniving and some backstabbing? It's "The Coup".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:30] It's a little bit making, MacBeth-y. I think that's a term. Look it up, MacBeth-y.

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:35] Season 3, Episode 3. Written by Paul Lieberstein and directed by Greg Daniels.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:41] You know what I would really love?

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:43] What?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:44] A summary.

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:45] Guess what, Angela? I have a summary.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:49] Why, by the way, why did I say that almost like Cookie Monster. A summary. Like.

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:56] I don't know. Here is my summary. It's a little bit like "Stacy".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:59] Oh, it is.

JENNA FISCHER [00:01:01] It's got some Stacy undertones.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:03] We're all Kevin.

JENNA FISCHER [00:01:05] It's a little Cookie Monster mixed with Kevin. Here is my summary. Michael gets into hot water with Jan after she catches him throwing a Movie Monday in the office, neglecting work. So egged on by Angela, a.k.a Lady Macbeth.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:24] Dun dun dun.

JENNA FISCHER [00:01:26] She convinces Dwight to undermine Michael by meeting up with Jan in an attempt to steal the manager position.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:33] You're going to see a whole new side of Steve Carell that is amazing in this episode.

JENNA FISCHER [00:01:38] At the same time, Kelly convinces Pam to have a fashion show.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:43] Fashion show.

JENNA FISCHER [00:01:45] Fashion show.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:47] Fashion show.

JENNA FISCHER [00:01:47] Fashion show at lunch. Fast Fact Number One. So this is a very, very big Rainn Wilson, Dwight Angela Michael episode. Wouldn't you say?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:02:02] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:02:02] This is like the three of you are really driving this episode.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:02:05] I mean, we have this weird love triangle, if you will. I feel like.

JENNA FISCHER [00:02:10] Yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:02:10] I mean, it's true. I feel like I'm in love with Dwight. He's in love with Michael.

JENNA FISCHER [00:02:15] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:02:16] It's weird.

JENNA FISCHER [00:02:17] Well, we really wanted Rainn Wilson to come on the podcast this week, and Rainn Wilson wanted to come on the podcast this week. But guess what? If you can believe it, we had some technical issues that kept us from being able to make that happen. However, Rainn Wilson did send in some audio clips and we're gonna sprinkle those in throughout. So he will be making an appearance, although very soon he will be making like an appearance appearance.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:02:44] I'm so bummed about the dang WiFi of it all. You guys, it gets glitches, it gets glitchy up in here. I don't know. What am I? Am I? What am I even talking like? Am I 21 in the club? What am I doing? Glitchy up in here.

JENNA FISCHER [00:03:00] Oh baby. That's not 21 in the club.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:03:02] It's not?

JENNA FISCHER [00:03:03] I mean, I hope it's not.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:03:05] Is it? Is it?

JENNA FISCHER [00:03:06] It's getting this glitchy up-, you think when you're21 in the club, you talk about glitchy WiFi?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:03:11] Glitchy up in here. That could be your undies in a wad. It could be anything.

JENNA FISCHER [00:03:16] All right. All right. Fair enough.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:03:16] You know what I'm saying? Glitchy up in here could mean a lot of things. But apparently when you're 48 in your converted tuff shed that you made into an office, you say is glitchy up in here.

JENNA FISCHER [00:03:27] We are so sorry that it's hashtag glitchy up in here. But we're gonna figure it out. We're gonna figure it out. So listen, my Fast Fact Number One is that even though this episode is the love triangle of Michael, Dwight and Angela, there was a big Internet stir.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:03:48] Mmmm.

JENNA FISCHER [00:03:49] As the kids would say. Do they say that? Do they say there's a stir? On the Internet?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:03:53] Pretty much. Pretty much. You and I have our finger on the pulse of the hip lingo.

JENNA FISCHER [00:03:58] Clearly.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:03:58] Do they say the Internet, the Internet was a stir?

JENNA FISCHER [00:04:01] The Internet was a stir with the fact that this episode has the first Jim Karen flirt.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:07] Oh. Oh, I know.

JENNA FISCHER [00:04:10] Oh, Angela. The Internet was a buzz. Was it a buzz?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:13] Well, you know what I like the internet was a stir.

JENNA FISCHER [00:04:16] All right.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:17] That's what I'm going to say now. It's glitchy up in here and the Internet was a stir about it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:04:23] Oh, dollface.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:24] Oh, dollface.

JENNA FISCHER [00:04:24] So, yes, the flirt begins. The distance between Jim and Pam is growing. They are not in touch, even though Jim does bring Pam up a couple of times in this episode. The message boards blew up. Do you remember that? After this episode came out, a lot of strong feelings, a lot of strong feelings.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:45] A lot of strong feelings. Poor Rashida.

JENNA FISCHER [00:04:48] About Jim and Karen.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:48] Rashida was like, I'm going to go into hiding. People hate me.

JENNA FISCHER [00:04:53] Except that she's so cute in this episode.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:56] She's so stinkin' cute. And you know what? She doesn't know about Pam. It's not her fault.

JENNA FISCHER [00:05:00] That's right.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:01] People always-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:05:01] She's not doing anything wrong.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:02] People were like just hating on Karen. But it's not Kare-. Karen's not doing anything wrong.

JENNA FISCHER [00:05:07] Yeah. I mean, do you think Jim ever told Karen about Pam? Probably not. Why would you bring that up?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:15] Heck no. Why would he bring that up? Also, for some weird reason, the only person Jim ever really confides in, too, is Michael.

JENNA FISCHER [00:05:22] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:22] So no. He did not tell Karen about Pam. No way.

JENNA FISCHER [00:05:28] All right. Well, this is leading me in to Fast Fact Number Two. Angela, you have a Fast Fact for us today, about Karen.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:35] I do. I have a Fast Fact about Karen. So Karen's name, Karen Filippelli, was based off an NBC exec named Rachel Filippelli. And this is just a classic Greg Daniels move that he loved to use people's names that he actually knew. I feel like all of our writers would probably pitch names of people they already knew. But Rachel Filippelli was an exec and Rashida said she actually met her. So Karen Filippelli was based off Rachel Filippelli.

JENNA FISCHER [00:06:05] Greg did that all the time. If you knew Greg, you better bet your name is going to end up in one of his shows.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:12] Also part of Fast Fact Two, Jenna. I don't know if you remember this, but Rashida would sometimes spill things on set and she got the nickname of Spill-epelli.

JENNA FISCHER [00:06:23] I don't remember that.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:25] Spill-epelli.

JENNA FISCHER [00:06:29] That's amazing. That's amazing. All right. I'm going to move us to a Fast Fact Number Three, because this is a huge Fast Fact. Angela, I don't know if it's that people are spending a lot of time at home, but this week we got a lot of mail from people that was very long, very involved, a lot of deep dives, a lot of conspiracies. And I'm going to go into this conspiracy sent in by Suzy Kowalski. This is the Jim Halpert sleeve conspiracy.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:07:02] You got my attention, Susie.

JENNA FISCHER [00:07:05] Here is what Susie says. "Guys, I took a deep dive on Jim sleeves, as you have done on Kelly's hair and shirts. Someone please tell me why for all of season 3, Jim sleeves are not rolled up. He is famously known for rolling up his sleeves. Yet in season 3, they are not rolled and he is even sometimes wearing a blazer". Here's what Susie says, "I believe it's love. Stay with me for a second".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:07:36] Oh god.

JENNA FISCHER [00:07:36] She wrote, "Stay with me for a second".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:07:38] Go on.

JENNA FISCHER [00:07:39] She says, "Jim's iconic look is him with his dress shirt sleeves rolled up and never wearing a blazer, even though the rest of the men in the office do. However, when Jim moves to Stamford, he's either wearing his blazer or his dress shirt with his sleeves not rolled up. Which is weird because also Andy does not wear a blazer. But after the merger, Andy wears a blazer everyday in Scranton".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:08:06] Oh, Susie. Oh, Susie.

JENNA FISCHER [00:08:08] All right, Susie also says, "This is also seen in Season 3, episode 3 and 4, not 2, because that's the convention. 5, 6, 7 and 8. 8 is the merger where Andy suddenly starts wearing a blazer all the time and Jim keeps not rolling his sleeves. But since he's, quote unquote home now, you would think he would go back to his old ways, but he doesn't. It's not fancy Stamford, Angela. It's not, he keeps not rolling his sleeves even when he gets back to Scranton". She says, "Even in episodes 9, 10, 11, even when in 11 he's in the warehouse handing Karen the lease. He's back in a blazer. But why? It continues in episodes 12 through 21, not 22, because that's Beach Day and episode 23. Guess what? Season 4, episode 1. No blazer. His sleeves are rolled up. I repeat, the sleeves are rolled up, people, Jim is back, baby". And this is her conclusion. "I believe Jim sleeves are directly correlated with his dating of Karen and not dating Pam. I think when he moved to Connecticut, the sleeves were his way of starting a new chapter. Maybe it's symbolic that he was never comfortable with Karen. He couldn't be his real self and roll up his sleeves. But in Season 4, episode 1's cold open, he's comfortable again. He rolls up his sleeves. And we know at this point he's dating Pam". Let's give her a clap.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:47] Susie, that is some seriously sleeve tracking. I applaud you on your attention to detail.

JENNA FISCHER [00:09:55] Susie asked if this was intentional or an accident. Susie, this was intentional.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:10:02] Susie, I'm telling you, you are making some, some ladies in wardrobe really, really happy. They did a lot of things like that. They would change our wardrobe depending on what our characters were going through. And wow, Susie, I am so impressed.

JENNA FISCHER [00:10:17] You're going to see a lot of moments from Pam where her wardrobe changes or her hair changes because of, you know, who she's dating or what she's up to. Some, some work, some don't. You know, we do that in life, right? We.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:10:31] We try on new looks. They're not all winners, guys.

JENNA FISCHER [00:10:34] We do.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:10:34] They're not all winners.

JENNA FISCHER [00:10:36] Well, listen, you know, we're all stuck inside. We're wondering what are we going to do? Maybe sometime you could do is rewatch Season 3 of the office and, and look at Jim's sleeves. See what Susie saw.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:10:50] Let me tell you something, Susie. From here out, I'm going to be looking at his sleeves. So.

JENNA FISCHER [00:10:54] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:10:56] All right. Fantastic Fast Facts, lady.

JENNA FISCHER [00:10:58] All right, guys, we're going to take a break and when we come back, we're going to break down "The Coup" and get ready for some sweet audio clips from Mr. Rainn Wilson. OK. We're back. We've got our cold open. Michael and Pam are popping some popcorn in the microwave because guess what? It's Movie Monday. I guess that means we find out in this episode that Michael makes everybody go in and watch a movie or maybe a medical video or maybe an episode of "Entourage".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:11:31] I have to tell you, at 42 seconds, Jenna, your look to camera when you said that they ran out of like instructional videos and you watched a medical video, your pause and look to camera is absolute genius.

JENNA FISCHER [00:11:44] Oh lady.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:11:44] It was so good.

JENNA FISCHER [00:11:45] You know, we got a lot of mail of people asking, why did I pause and look at camera?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:11:50] Because he made you watch a medical video. OK, I rewatched this with my daughter. And she was like, Mom, what is, what's the deal with the medical video? I was like, imagine they ran out of, like, videos related to paper supply or work related videos. And then he just found one on how do you give someone a root canal? And you had to watch that. She was like, ew! And I was like, exactly.

JENNA FISCHER [00:12:13] Exactly. Also, that looked to camera that you're talking about, that is in the script. In the script, it says Pam looks at, gives camera a look like, can you believe it?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:12:24] Oh my lord, it was so good.

JENNA FISCHER [00:12:26] Well, you know, Michael says this is the only cure for the Monday blues. And then he goes into his cabinet, lady. At 13 seconds, he goes into his cabinet, into his safe, to get a copy of "Varsity Blues". Do we need to revisit all of the things in his cabinet?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:12:48] You know, I saw Pringle's I saw the rubber chicken that has to be in the safe. You know?

JENNA FISCHER [00:12:54] Yeah. There is a blue pack of gum.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:12:56] Mmhmm.

JENNA FISCHER [00:12:57] Here's the thing. His silver tea set that was in there during Dwight's speech. Where did it go?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:13:02] I don't know. He had to move it for his movie stash. There's more than one movie in there.

JENNA FISCHER [00:13:06] There's also a new photo of Jan taped over the old photo. The old photo was a picture of Jan, like from a newsletter when her last name was still Levinson-Gould. And now there's some other photo, but I couldn't, I couldn't catch it, exactly what it was.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:13:25] I like to think that it's a photo he took of her that she didn't want him to take.

JENNA FISCHER [00:13:29] Oh, 100 percent.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:13:30] Well, I have a little something about this cold open. Sam, will you play my sting?

JENNA FISCHER [00:13:36] What's going on?

STING [00:13:38] And now it's time for Kinsey tidbit.

JENNA FISCHER [00:13:47] Hey! Look who got her kids in on it.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:13:48] All three of them, we had to make a sentence so they could all have an equal amount of time so it was fair. You guys know how it is. With multiple children it all has to be fair or somebody get their feelings hurt. So-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:14:00] We got a Kinsey tidbit.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:02] I have a Kinsey tidbit about this cold open. Jenna Fischer, did you know that in 1999 I auditioned for "Varsity Blues"?

JENNA FISCHER [00:14:12] What?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:13] Oh yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:14:15] What?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:15] I did. I auditioned for the part that Ali Larter got, Darcy Spears, the cheerleading captain. She was known famously in this movie as the character who comes out in a whipped cream bikini.

JENNA FISCHER [00:14:30] Oh, my gosh.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:31] Whipped cream bikini to Mox, who was played by James Van Der Beek. Yeah, she seduces him in a whipped cream bikini. That's the role I auditioned for. I did not get it. So there you go.

JENNA FISCHER [00:14:44] Lady. I have questions.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:47] Yeah, go.

JENNA FISCHER [00:14:48] Did you have to do any cheerleading as part of your audition or the fact that you had been a cheerleader? Was that a plus?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:56] That was a plus.

JENNA FISCHER [00:14:56] Did it come up in your audition?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:58] It came up in my audition. Yes. That I had had cheerleading experience. I think it's probably, I was such a, like, unknown nobody. I think it's probably how I got the audition because I was, my, I could imagine my agent at the time who is like, she's from Texas. Because it takes place in Texas. She is blond. She was a cheerleader.

JENNA FISCHER [00:15:18] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:18] So I got the audition and I had, like, my Texas accent and everything. I did not get the part. It's okay. But I had read the sides and I remember being like, whipped cream bikini. How does that stay on? How does that work? And this movie, "Varsity Blues", I had to go see it because I had to see, you know, the role I didn't get. And there are so many things that if you're from Texas, you're like, eh, okay, whatever. That's a, that's a bit much. But one of my favorite lines that my friends and I used to say to each other was by James Van Der Beek and his Southern accent. As the character, Mox, he gets into a fight with the football coach who's played by Jon Voight. They had some, like, big names in this movie. And he looks at them, goes, "I don't want your life". Yeah, we would say to each other all the time. All the time. Hey, what's up? I don't want your life. OK. All right. Relax.

JENNA FISCHER [00:16:16] How did you feel when you did not get the part? Were you super bummed or were you relieved that you didn't have to wear a whipped cream bikini? Or both? Was it a mix?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:16:24] I think it was a mix. It was a mix. I was like, oh, I think this is gonna be a big movie, you know? Like.

JENNA FISCHER [00:16:29] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:16:30] And I never got to-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:16:30] This is a game change, that would have been a game changer.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:16:33] Game changer. I never got to audition for movies. I was just really just going in on commercials. That was my, my big success is I had, you know, done a commercial about potato chips that gave you anal leakage. So, you know?

JENNA FISCHER [00:16:45] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:16:46] This would have been a big deal. Pretty much on camera, all I said was, "Wow". And then took a bite of a potato chip. So it would have been a really big deal, but I didn't get it. And that's OK. And that is my Kinsey dip it from the cold open.

JENNA FISCHER [00:17:02] I love your Kinsey tidbit. I thought that was very, very good Kinsey tidbit.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:07] Thank you. Thank you.

JENNA FISCHER [00:17:09] We also had a fan question about this cold open, Angela. We had a lot of people ask, what did we do with all the extra popcorn? Because Pam pops a bunch of popcorn and then no one takes it. You guys, we ate it and we also just put it out on the snack table for the crew. We did eat all that popcorn. It was great. I'll never forget it.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:29] Yeah, we were excited about popcorn.

JENNA FISCHER [00:17:30] We had a lot of snacks all the time. But all of our snacks, they had to be very quiet snacks because the snack table was behind the walls of the set. So our crafty people, they couldn't pop microwave popcorn because we were shooting and it would make noise. Remember, we had that one cappuccino machine for like a hot second, Angela, but it was so loud and it kept ruining takes because people would go back and fix themselves like a, a frothy cappuccino while we were trying to shoot. And they were like, get that machine out of here. So this was, I mean, to say we were tickled to have some, like microwave popcorn, we actually really were. Because it was usually all things that made no noise.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:12] Yeah. Like, a lot of our snacks were like cheese.

JENNA FISCHER [00:18:15] Lot of cheese.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:16] Lot of cheese.

JENNA FISCHER [00:18:17] Guys, don't worry. Angela did not string it.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:19] Who had time for it? I don't have time for that. So I guess Pam also shares that they watched an episode of "Entourage" six times.

JENNA FISCHER [00:18:28] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:29] A. Which episode? I wish we knew. But Jenna, did you know that our lovable curmudgeon, Rainn Wilson was a guest star on "Entourage"?

JENNA FISCHER [00:18:39] No, he was not.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:41] Oh yeah, he was. Rainn, this delighted me so much. Rainn was in Season 2, Episode 9. The episode is called "I Love You Too". He played RJ Spencer, who was an Internet comic expert, and he interviews Vincent Chase at basically the San Diego Comic Con because get this. Vincent just got the big role of Aquaman, OK?

JENNA FISCHER [00:19:07] Oh, yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:08] Oh, yeah. And so RJ Spencer is going to interview him. But during the interview, Jenna, he starts talking about, I heard that you were engaged to Mandy Moore and she broke up with you, you know?

JENNA FISCHER [00:19:20] Oh.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:21] And guess what? This pisses Vincent off.

JENNA FISCHER [00:19:23] Oh Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:24] Vincent calls them an a-hole.

JENNA FISCHER [00:19:24] This is not the interview he was expecting.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:27] No. And he calls them in a-hole and he storms off. And RJ is like, I will ruin you. I will write horrible reviews of Aquaman. You know, you had your chance and I'm going to destroy you on the Internet. OK, so now E, Vincent's manager, right?

JENNA FISCHER [00:19:46] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:47] He's got to fix this. He's like, what do you want? You know, he's like trying to bribe him.

JENNA FISCHER [00:19:51] What happens?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:52] RJ says, I want 350,000 dollars or I'm gonna destroy Aquaman online. So meanwhile, Johnny Drama is at Comic Con, and he has a really good friend and adult film star, Jesse Jane, played by Jesse Jane. She's promoting her fake comic series titled "[Beep] Patrol". So E says, hey, will you guys visit, quote, RJ in his hotel room?

JENNA FISCHER [00:20:22] Oh boy.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:22] And convince him not to write a bad review of Aquaman? And because of her love of Vincent, she's like, yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:20:28] Wow.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:28] And her and two of her pals in very, very interesting outfits go and knock on the door. And RJ is like, woah, woah. And guess what?

JENNA FISCHER [00:20:39] Does Rainn have a love scene with three women?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:42] I need to ask him about it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:20:43] Oh "Entourage"?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:43] I need to ask him about it because they go in there, they shut the door. We don't know what happens. But I wonder if there was ever a scene of anything happening.

JENNA FISCHER [00:20:53] Like was there a scene that didn't make the episode?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:55] I don't know. But then, of course, he writes, you know, Aquaman glowing review. So there you go. Rainn. Rainn, I have questions. I have questions for you. I will be texting you later.

JENNA FISCHER [00:21:10] I really wish I knew this before Rainn sent in his audio clips because I feel like the audio clips would have more.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:21] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:21:22] More. They would have anything to say about this. Here's, when I was listening to your description of this episode. It became very clear to me why I didn't watch "Entourage". That, and I feel good about that. I feel good that I didn't watch it. And I feel like, yeah, good call.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:40] There you go. Rainn Wilson as R.J. Spencer on "Entourage".

JENNA FISCHER [00:21:45] I kind of want to see just that episode. Maybe just Rainn's scenes.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:50] I just fast forwarded to Rainn scenes. You don't really need to see anything else from it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:21:53] That was some shade.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:55] And so now we can get into the episode.

JENNA FISCHER [00:21:58] Jan is visiting unexpectedly and discovering Movie Monday.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:04] Yeah. And guess what? Not everyone approves of Movie Monday, Jenna.

JENNA FISCHER [00:22:08] No, Angela, you do not approve.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:09] I do not approve. It is me. I will own it. I do not approve. And then Angela is so sneaky when Jan comes in. She like points to the conference room like. Tattletale.

JENNA FISCHER [00:22:21] She is. But Angela at 1 minute, 49 seconds. Where are you sitting for this talking head? You're by a window. And there's a plant. Where are you?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:32] I know where I am, because there's a-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:22:34] Where?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:34] There's a deleted scene that's not in here where Dwight has to come find me. Michael's like, go get Angela. Right? And Dwight's like, why me? He plays this really coy, it's sort of a hilarious performance of like, well, I don't know where she is.

JENNA FISCHER [00:22:49] Yes. Why are you asking me for Angela?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:51] Yeah. And then he goes and finds her and he knows exactly where she is. I am sitting behind the vending machine, sort of squished up in the wall behind the plant on a chair. And I am needle pointing a, like a cat. I'm needlepointing a cat. And that's where this talking head is.

JENNA FISCHER [00:23:11] Oh. Yes. And there is that window that goes from the break room into that little hallway.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:17] Into the hallway. And there's a big plant there.

JENNA FISCHER [00:23:20] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:21] And that's where I'm sitting. 'Cause there was a whole-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:23:22] Oh, it was driving me nuts.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:24] There's a whole scene that happens there that didn't make it in the episode where I start plotting, that's the first seed I plant is that you wouldn't do this as a manager. You wouldn't waste everyone's time like this.

JENNA FISCHER [00:23:39] I see.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:39] All while needlepointing a face of a cat.

JENNA FISCHER [00:23:44] I love that. All right, we have a fan catch, Angela. Beth Boss says, "When Jan walks in, she puts her bag and coat down on the chair in front of Michael's office. But when Angela points to the conference room and the camera cuts back to Jan, she's holding her coat and she's just now putting it down in the chair". Good catch, Beth Boss.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:24:02] Way to go. And there's some, some Dwangela sass in this episode, as we know. And two of my favorite Dwangela sass lines are coming up around 2 minutes, 39, Angela's telling Dwight to meet her in the kitchen and she says that Jan is going to be peeved off. Jan is peeved off. And then Dwight in his talking heads said, yeah, Jan's really been bitching out on him ever since he broke up with her. I'm like, what is up with Dwangela? They're like kind of cursing. They're being, they're being a little tacky. Jenna.

JENNA FISCHER [00:24:39] Oh, you think so?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:24:41] I think they're being a little tacky. That's, I feel like-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:24:44] They've hit their limit, Angela, they can't take it anymore. They can't take the inefficiency. They can't take, you know. You know what happens? It's like for all these years, they've been separately stewing over all of this. But now that they're together, you know how that happens in a couple?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:25:02] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:25:02] Now they're kind of like mind melding.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:25:06] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:25:07] Well, Ang, I love this scene with Dwight and Angela in the kitchen. It's around 2 minutes, 42 seconds. You guys are back to back again, not facing one another. Angela's telling Dwight that he's the one who should be running the office and he should talk to Jan about it. We had a fan question.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:25:26] OK.

JENNA FISCHER [00:25:26] From Evan Warburton. He says, "Angela, did it make it easier or more difficult to film a scene when the characters are back to back? Because I know that Rainn and Angela did quite a few scenes like this, like, did it make it easier to stay in character because you didn't have to make eye contact? What was it like"? Tell us, Angela.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:25:49] Well, I'll tell you this. The biggest thing about these scenes that I remember was timing, because you cannot see the other person speaking. So, you know, you don't respond quite the same way because you want to make sure they finish their sentence or sort of whatever they're doing, they're emoting. Right?

JENNA FISCHER [00:26:06] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:26:07] Whatever their thing is. So I remember the first time we did it, there were probably more pauses because we wanted to sort of make sure we had the give and take, because naturally, when you talk to someone, you're reading their face.

JENNA FISCHER [00:26:18] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:26:19] And so it was sort of just like acting off of someone's voice as well, like all of my reacting was in listening. I think in some ways it made us more thoughtful performers because we couldn't face the other person. And we had to really listen to them and react off the last thing they said.

JENNA FISCHER [00:26:37] Did it make it hard to improvise?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:26:41] Oh, for sure. I remember really being conscious of not improvising any lines within a written scene. And anything that I did improvise came at the very end when I knew I wouldn't be stepping on anything, Rainn said. So most of my improv in these scenes, if it made it in, was something I said as I was leaving or, or at the very beginning.

JENNA FISCHER [00:27:00] That makes sense.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:27:02] So, yeah. So they have this scene in the kitchen. Angela storms out. She's furious. She tells Dwight he needs to grow a pair. Right? In a talking head. See what I mean? Jenna, she is, she has had it. And on, on growing a pair. Let's, let's move to Stamford.

JENNA FISCHER [00:27:18] Let's grow a pair and move to Stamford.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:27:22] All right, so what's happening in Fancy Stamford, Jenna?

JENNA FISCHER [00:27:25] They're playing "Call of Duty".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:27:26] Oh.

JENNA FISCHER [00:27:27] Jim explains that what started as a team building exercise has now turned into this super competitive game of "Call of Duty", which keeps interrupting their work day. He mentions, this is where Jim brings up Pam. He's like, yeah, we didn't really play video games in Scranton, but, you know, we did other things like Pam and I would hum a high pitched tone and try to convince Dwight that he needed to see an ear doctor. Pam called it pretend-anitis.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:27:57] Oh. Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.

JENNA FISCHER [00:28:00] He's just thinking of Pam.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:00] Oh, Lordy.

JENNA FISCHER [00:28:01] But then back in Scranton, Angela, Pam is not talking about Jim. She's signing for a package. She's gotten a delivery.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:08] Listen, she went on a date last, the week before. Right?

JENNA FISCHER [00:28:12] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:12] She went on a date. Now she's getting some new clothes with the help of Kelly Kapoor. Before we really dive into this scene, you guys, 4 minutes, 36 seconds. Is Mindy wearing as side ponytail? Come on.

JENNA FISCHER [00:28:28] You're bringing up her side ponytail. What about her bangs?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:32] I mean.

JENNA FISCHER [00:28:32] She has bangs.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:33] She has bangs, but she's a, she has an extension filled side ponytail.

JENNA FISCHER [00:28:39] There's a lot happening with her hair.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:41] I don't have a sting for it, but it would go "Full Mindy".

JENNA FISCHER [00:28:45] Yeah. Why don't we have a full Mindy sting?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:47] I don't know.

JENNA FISCHER [00:28:47] We really need to get on that.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:48] Someone make us a "Full Mindy" sting. Someone do it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:28:49] Well, this leads to a very famous office line. "Fashion show. Fashion Show. Fashion Show at lunch".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:58] "Fashion show at lunch".

JENNA FISCHER [00:28:59] Yes. Yes. Guys, that is 100 percent scripted. That was in the script. That was not an improv. It was written exactly like that. Mindy delivers it perfectly. We had a lot of fan questions about this scene. People mostly wanted to know, did I get to pick out the outfits that Pam gets in her online shopping spree? And also, were there more things in the box besides that single shirt that she gets out and wears later in the kitchen? OK. Yes, we had a big wardrobe fitting about what would these outfits be and there were more things in the box. But I'll have to tell you, they were basically that same shirt, but there was a turquoise one. There was a lot of jewel toned shirts that looked almost identical to that one shirt that you see. And that was kind of part of the joke because have you done that when you're shopping? You're like, I'm going to get a whole new wardrobe. And then you just kind of go to the store and buy the same pair of pants and three colors.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:30:00] Oh, my gosh, I always do that. I find like one shirt I like and then buy it in three colors. And people are like, hey, I, oh, have you worn that? Oh I. Is that a? And I'm like, no, it's the same shirt. It's the same shirt.

JENNA FISCHER [00:30:11] Yeah. That was kind of what happened with Pam's like redesign of her wardrobe was that she managed to find one thing that she was willing to take a chance on and then bought it in different colors.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:30:23] Here's what I remember about that, Jenna, because all of us saw each other every day pretty much in the same wardrobe, right?

JENNA FISCHER [00:30:30] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:30:30] Whenever one of our characters did get anything slightly different, we were like, hey. So I remember our reactions to your red fancy blouse, so similar to our characters, minus the gross pervy stuff. But we were like, oh, you look so great. Oh my god. You look amazing. And you're like, it's just the wardrobe for the scene.

JENNA FISCHER [00:30:54] It did feel like that whenever we got a slightly fancier hairdo or a slightly cooler outfit.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:00] Yeah. The whole.

JENNA FISCHER [00:31:01] Everyone noticed.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:01] Everyone. Cast and crew.

JENNA FISCHER [00:31:03] We all talked about it.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:04] We were like, wow, look at that. Oh. So now we're back at Stamford, my lady.

JENNA FISCHER [00:31:10] Back at Stamford.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:11] Andy is getting ticked off at Jim for killing the wrong soldiers in "Call of Duty".

JENNA FISCHER [00:31:18] Yes. And did you notice at 4 minutes and 59 seconds. There is still a blue sticky note on Jim's computer that says "Smile"?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:24] No, I didn't notice. That was a great catch.

JENNA FISCHER [00:31:28] Yeah, it's still there. Angela, you know what that sound means?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:34] I do, my lady. I do. We get a lot of questions about different behind the scenes moments on "The Office". And we always try our best to give you the Real Deal.

JENNA FISCHER [00:31:43] Just like our friends at State Farm. If you want to know how much you can save on your auto insurance by bundling it with your home policy, they'll always give you the answers you need when you need them.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:54] So we teamed up with State Farm to give you the Real Deal behind your favorite episodes of "The Office". This week's question comes from Shelby Hagan.

SHELBY HAGEN [00:32:03] Hi, Angela and Jenna. I'm so excited to be on your podcast. My question is, how is the "Call of Duty" game chosen to be played in the Stamford branch?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:12] Thank you so much for your question, Shelby. We actually got so many questions about "Call of Duty", and this seemed like the perfect one to get us started. As you guys know, Jenna and I were not in those scenes at Stamford.

JENNA FISCHER [00:32:25] That's right. So, Shelby, I reached out to a lot of people to get you the Real Deal on all things "Call of Duty". Angela, I got all the scoop from our line producer, Kent Zbornak. I texted with our editor, Dean Holland and Andy Bernard himself, Ed Helms.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:42] Lady, that is a serious deep dive. I like it. I like it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:32:46] I deep dived. I, I really did.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:48] OK. So would you find out?

JENNA FISCHER [00:32:50] All right. So Kent told me that after we wrapped Season 1 of the show, the post-production guys moved to some offices in Venice to edit the episodes. And while they were there, Kent just for whatever reason, just on a whim installed "Call of Duty" on everyone's computers just so they could blow off steam during edit sessions. And then when we moved to our new stages for Season 2, he did it again. But this time he also installed it on all the writers' computers, and that is when the editors and the writers started playing one another.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:26] I remember this because our editors and writers were in the same building. There were over where the warehouse is. Right? And the writers were upstairs and the editors were downstairs. And sometimes I would go over there at lunch because I was friends with Claire Scanlon, one of our editors at the time, and I would walk in the editing bay and they were all like, get down! Over here! And I was like, what is happening?

JENNA FISCHER [00:33:48] I remember going up to the writers' room and seeing the same thing. They had this big conference table in the writers' room and they would have all their computers in a circle. And then some people had little offices and then some people would be around this conference room table. And it was the same thing. They did exactly like what Stamford did. They would turn off the lights.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:34:08] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:34:09] And they would have this elaborate match going on.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:34:12] Oh, my gosh. They were so into it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:34:14] Well, I guess Greg Daniels was particularly obsessed. In fact, our editor, Dean Holland, told me that the very first time he met with Greg to start editing an episode within about 10 minutes, Greg said, have you ever played "Call of Duty"? And Dean was like, yeah. And he said, Greg left the room and started a 20 person game. Like within 10 minutes.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:34:38] How perfect that Greg was the person that directed this episode because he loves "Call of Duty".

JENNA FISCHER [00:34:42] I know.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:34:43] He loves it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:34:43] I don't think that I don't think that was a mistake.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:34:46] No, no. All right. Well, I have a little runner up, Real Deal question for you. Jenna.

JENNA FISCHER [00:34:53] OK.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:34:53] So Evan Warburton wrote in and said, "Hey, I need to point this out. Jim is apparently horrible at 'Call of Duty' at the Stamford branch in this episode. But in the episode, 'Email Surveillance', you can see in the background of the scene at 20 minutes, 8 seconds that Toby is playing 'Call of Duty' on Jim's TV". Remember at the barbecue, Jenna?

JENNA FISCHER [00:35:14] Yes. Yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:15] OK. So and then also in Jim's bedroom, at 15 minutes, 52 seconds, you can see an expansion pack of "Call of Duty" on Jim's desk. Come on, someone, please explain.

JENNA FISCHER [00:35:27] All right. Yes. We actually had a lot of people write in about this glitch. I went to that time code 15 minutes, 52 seconds. There it is. There is an expansion pack. "Call of Duty". Here's how this went down, guys.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:40] OK.

JENNA FISCHER [00:35:40] Kent told me that the writers had a card up on the wall in the writers' room all through Season 2 about a possible "Call of Duty" storyline. But they couldn't really ever figure out how to put it in. And they had originally thought about doing something in "E-mail Surveillance". And if you remember, Angela, we did actually shoot some scenes where people were playing "Call of Duty" during Jim's party.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:05] Yeah. And-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:36:05] But it wasn't a storyline.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:07] Yeah, it wasn't a storyline. It was just something people were doing at the party, kind of in the background. But that was there in the script.

JENNA FISCHER [00:36:14] Yeah. And it didn't really, though, go anywhere. So finally when they went to Stamford, they wrote this full plot line and they had to just live with the fact that there had been this tiny appearance of "Call of Duty" earlier, but they so wanted a full "Call of Duty" story that they just went with it. It was like it, it's worth it.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:36] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever, whatever "E-mail Surveillance". We've got to have a real episode that features "Call of Duty". You know what I did for myself, the way I made it make sense is that Jim had roommates.

JENNA FISCHER [00:36:48] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:48] He had roommates who probably played it. Maybe it was never his thing. You know?

JENNA FISCHER [00:36:52] Maybe he stole the expansion pack and put it in his room to make his roommate stop playing. Maybe that's why it's in his room.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:59] Alright.

JENNA FISCHER [00:36:59] Along with his guitar that he never plays.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:01] OK. Jenna and Suzie. Come on. Come on. So I listen to the DVD commentary for this episode and Jenna, Rashida said that she got lessons on how to play "Call of Duty" from the writers. As soon as she got the job, they started teaching her how to play "Call of Duty", which just cracks me up. And John actually had something really sweet to say in the commentary. He said that going to the Stamford branch, all of those actors had never worked together before. Right? And that playing "Call of Duty" with one another was actually a really fun icebreaker to get to know everyone.

JENNA FISCHER [00:37:34] You know, Ed and I traded some messages and he said the same thing. He said they all played with the writers and it was really, really fun. And he told me that they also played for real on set.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:45] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:37:45] They were really playing during those scenes. And then when they would cut, they would just keep playing. He said it was a lot of fun and people got super, super into it.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:54] I have a little FOMO. I have a little FOMO about it because I feel like we would have had fun with that at Scranton. I mean-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:38:00] See. We knew they were having fun over there without us.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:03] We knew it. Dang it. All we were doing was playing solitaire.

JENNA FISCHER [00:38:06] Exactly.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:06] Oh, Jenna. Did you get any scoop in your deep dive on who was the best player? Who was our best player?

JENNA FISCHER [00:38:12] Well, I don't think any of the actors were very good.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:15] Oh, really?

JENNA FISCHER [00:38:17] Ed said he didn't remember anyone being particularly great, including himself. Kent told me that he was the best player when they started, but that during the editing phase of Season 1 when they were in Venice, co-producer Angie Hamilton was the best hands.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:32] Wow.

JENNA FISCHER [00:38:34] But then, see, it sort of depends on who you ask, because Dean told me that during Season 2, he and writer Mike Schur were the best. They were at the top of the leaderboard. He said they got so into it that they took it over to "Parks and Rec" when they moved over there and they played it everyday on "Parks and Rec". And Kent did concur that Mike and Dean left as champions. But he also said that their assistant editor, Mike Zurer, was pretty great.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:01] All right. All right. Well, I think those were fantastic questions. Thank you so much, Shelby and Evan. There you have it. When you want the Real Deal on "The Office", we're your ladies.

JENNA FISCHER [00:39:11] When you want the Real Deal on insurance like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:16] If you want to submit questions about a future episode, just head over to OfficeLadies.com/RealDeal. And if we pick your question to be our Real Deal question on the show, we will send you a swag bag of fun stuff, including an "Office Ladies" hoodie and a signed "Office Ladies" mug. All right. So now at 5 minutes, 12 seconds, we're in the parking lot. Dwight, you know, he's kind of psyching himself up like he does that we've seen him do this before, like in the stairwell. And in the DVD commentary, Rainn mention that that run that he does in the parking lot that Paul Lieberstein showed him exactly how he wanted that run done. So.

JENNA FISCHER [00:39:51] Really?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:51] I picture of these two guys just running back and forth. It makes me laugh thinking about it. And then Dwight calls Jan and-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:40:00] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:40:00] He says, hey, I need to talk to you. It's not safe here. He's crouching down. People are walking about. Kevin's around and he tells her to go to the Liz Claiborne outlet at Exit 40 because he knows that she likes buying those blouses from Liz Claiborne.

JENNA FISCHER [00:40:16] Yeah. He says he'll, he'll meet her there. Right?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:40:18] Yeah, I'll meet you at the Liz Claiborne outlet. He says go in and shop. I'll meet you there.

JENNA FISCHER [00:40:23] And she says, "How do you know I like their blouses"? And he says, "It's part of my job to know". And then she has that great line where she's like, "It literally is not part of your job".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:40:35] Yeah, he's like-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:40:35] It's, it's absolutely not part of your job to know this.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:40:38] And then Dwight's, like, "Noted". How long is Dwight been tracking her clothes? I feel like Dwight is the tracker, the way we track things on the podcast. That's what Dwight was doing of like everyone in the office.

JENNA FISCHER [00:40:51] He's got some real creepy notebooks.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:40:52] Oh, he has meticulous, creepy notes. Lady, I had to do a deep dive. The minute he said exit 40, I had to know, are there Liz Claiborne outlets at exit 40? So I can tell you all the outlets in Pennsylvania. Did you go there, lady? Did you go there?

JENNA FISCHER [00:41:07] OK. I did not go there, Angela, because remember when I said earlier that our fans got real into some deep dives on this. We had multiple people write in about Liz Claiborne outlets and exit 40. Jenny Aguayer wrote in to say, "There is no exit 40, according to three Google map suggestions from Scranton to New York". Did you find that, Angela? No exit 40?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:41:30] Yeah. I couldn't find an exit 40 either.

JENNA FISCHER [00:41:33] OK. Well, Makayla Brock said that the only Liz Claiborne's store near Scranton is in Ramsey, New Jersey, which is about an hour and 45 minutes away on the quickest route. But Elizabeth M. said that Jan has said she's been driving an hour supposedly to New York City. Which would not be on the way to this Liz Claiborne outlet that is in New Jersey and it would actually add 25 miles to her drive.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:42:02] Well, I want you to know, when I was in junior high and my favorite perfume was the Liz Claiborne perfume.

JENNA FISCHER [00:42:08] Oh.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:42:08] It came in a little like triangle, you know? And you took the top off. I loved Liz Claiborne perfume. So I would have been very excited about this Liz Claiborne outlets. And my mom loves the outlets. We had-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:42:22] Oh, yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:42:23] Had to pull off on the side of the road like she would say to my dad, "Bill, there's the outlets". Here we go.

JENNA FISCHER [00:42:29] Oh, my mom loves the outlets. There is a Carter's outlet. There's a Baby Gap outlet. My mom shops at the outlet and she sends just like bags of clothes to me for my kids from these outlets. It's the best. Guys, loving on the outlets.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:42:45] So you can go to OutletLocator.com and type in your state and find out your outlets. So this is what I found. There are three outlets in Pennsylvania for Liz Claiborne. There's one in Lancaster, one in Hershey and one in Redding. And then, lady, when we get to it later, I'll let you know what OutletLocator.com says about Ann Taylor. I'll hold on to that. I'll hold onto it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:43:08] Oh, yes. That, many people wrote in about Ann Taylor. So we'll put a pin in that.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:13] So and then, you know, Dwight gets off the phone and he tells Michael he has an emergency crown that he has to get put in. Michael's like ew, that, you know, that sucks. And he said, yeah, it's a new dentist that is three hours away. And off Dwight goes.

JENNA FISCHER [00:43:28] Well, Makayla Brock wants you to know that if Dwight goes to a Liz Claiborne's store in New Jersey, he would have been gone longer than three hours because driving time alone would have been three hours. He wouldn't have even had time to meet with Jan.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:41] Guys. We did not think this through.

JENNA FISCHER [00:43:43] Our writers did not go to OutletLocator.com when they wrote this scene.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:48] They did not.

JENNA FISCHER [00:43:49] Well, what, wherever he went, Dwight is now in a parking lot with Jan and she has done some shopping. She's got some bags.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:55] She's got some bags. I have a question for you, Jenna, since I know you have the scripts. There is this line that Dwight says to Jan and I feel like it's Rainn improving when he said, "Did you get a new blouse, halter top, camisole, teddy"? Is that Rainn improvising?

JENNA FISCHER [00:44:12] Yeah. All of that was scripted, except for teddy.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:14] Teddy, there you go. I knew one of them.

JENNA FISCHER [00:44:16] He threw in teddy at the end.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:17] I knew one of them had to be Rainn.

JENNA FISCHER [00:44:20] You would be friends with Kate Lonergan who wrote in that same question, lady.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:24] Oh, hi, Kate.

JENNA FISCHER [00:44:25] All right. So now Dwight and Jan have a meeting at a nearby restaurant. And this is where Dwight really turns on Michael and he starts to campaign to take over the office.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:37] He campaigns and grosses me out at the same time. I mean, I am impressed with his no look pour. A no look pour of syrup is no joke.

JENNA FISCHER [00:44:47] Lady, that was scripted.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:49] I, I mean, that was amazing.

JENNA FISCHER [00:44:51] I thought the same thing. I looked it up in the script and there is a stage direction that says, here's what it says. "Dwight takes the syrup as he talks without breaking eye contact with Jan and pours it over everything on his plate". Amazing.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:45:07] Amazing.

JENNA FISCHER [00:45:08] We did get some questions, lady, about his eating of the waffles and pancakes, which is also delightful. That was not scripted. Rainn just ate how he wanted to eat. Casey Halpin asked, "How much of those waffles and pancakes did Rainn have to eat in that scene? Was he really eating them or did he have a spit bucket"?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:45:27] Well, guess what? Rainn Wilson answers this eating question.

JENNA FISCHER [00:45:32] All right, let's play the clip, Sam. Here's what Rainn has to say.

RAINN WILSON [00:45:36] Here's my deal about eating scenes. I love to eat during eating scenes. I love, and you'll see, Dwight, he'll always when there's an eating scene, he's got a mouth full of food. To me, it's really funny. He's just wolfing down big bites of food, talking while eating, and it's disgusting. But it just felt really, really right for the character. And I also like it as an actor. So this was a joy to cover. And I love that stage direction of Dwight's eyes never leave Jan's as he covers his plate entirely in syrup. And Melora Hardin is such a joy to act with because she's so specific and so underplayed, and no matter what you throw at her, she's right there. She's totally game and always in character.

JENNA FISCHER [00:46:30] All right. So there you have it, guys. Rainn was really eating. He was really eating, not spitting them out. Rainn did not use a spit bucket.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:46:39] I have done a lot of scenes with Rainn Wilson. And I can tell you, the guy goes for it. He goes for it across the board, whatever it is. So if he was going to eat a waffle, by golly, he's going to eat that waffle.

JENNA FISCHER [00:46:50] Well, thank you, Rainn. Thank you for sending in that clip. We've got more guys coming up. This is also the scene, lady, where at the end of the scene, he tells Jan there's an Ann Taylor store nearby and he knows that she likes the earrings.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:03] Melora's performance as Jan is so great. She's like, "Where is it"?

JENNA FISCHER [00:47:08] Yeah, she's like, yeah, where is it? I do actually, I do want to look at the earrings. Well, Makayla Brock wants you to know that while there are 20 Ann Taylor stores around the Scranton area, the nearest one to a Liz Claiborne is about 16 minutes away. Now, Jenny added, Angela, I told you these, everyone deep dived on this. There is an outlet mall roughly an hour away from Scranton. I think this is the one you're talking about. It's on the I-80 East route. It's called the Crossings Premium Outlet. Did you find this one?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:45] Well, I can tell you on OutletLocator.com, there is an Ann Taylor outlet in Lancaster as well.

JENNA FISCHER [00:47:52] Yep.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:52] And also one in Hershey as well. So if you were at Liz Claiborne, you could hit Ann Taylor at both of those outlets. And then there's another one in Tannersville and Pottstown.

JENNA FISCHER [00:48:03] But there's no Liz Claiborne at those.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:05] No. But you have a Liz Claiborne crossover at Hershey and Lancaster.

JENNA FISCHER [00:48:12] Well, Jenny was noting that at the Crossing's Premium Outlet, there is also Billy's Pocono Diner. So they serve breakfast and it is possible that that's where they were eating. And then Jan could pop over to that Ann Taylor. According to Kento-apedia, however, for anyone who wants to know, this was shot in Toluca Lake, California, at Patty's Diner. The famous Patty's Diner.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:41] All right.

JENNA FISCHER [00:48:42] I've eaten there. And so I can tell you with great authority that Rainn Wilson was eating delicious pancakes and waffles at Patty's.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:50] All right. Well, we've got to get back to the Scranton branch because the shitake is about to hit the fan.

JENNA FISCHER [00:48:56] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:57] But before we do that. Let's take a little break.

JENNA FISCHER [00:48:59] Yeah, let's take a break. I'm going to refill my coffee. Is that cool?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:03] You refill your coffee. I'm probably gonna go pee. Overshare? Maybe. That's where I'm at.

JENNA FISCHER [00:49:07] You always pee during our breaks. It's kind of like, remember when you gave me grief about saying, do you want to hear a summary? Do you want to hear a Fast Fact when you know I'm going to say them anyway? It's kind of like, you don't have to tell us that you're going to pee on the breaks anymore because we all just know.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:24] Listen.

JENNA FISCHER [00:49:25] We just know.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:26] Ok, fine.

JENNA FISCHER [00:49:26] You have a tiny bladder.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:27] I have a tiny bladder. I'm a tiny person.

JENNA FISCHER [00:49:30] I do as well. Listen, I pee on every break too. I just haven't been talking about it, but.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:34] Well, I am hell on a road trip if we can ever road trip again. You don't want me in the car with you because I need to know where I can pee. I'm that person. Where am I gonna pee? Where am I gonna pee? Where am I gonna pee? Get me an ice tea. Where am I gonna pee?

JENNA FISCHER [00:49:49] I know that's the, I, I drink my way through a road trip. Just sodas and water and snacks and then also pee 7 times. Sorry.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:50:00] Maybe we are perfect partners for road tripping because we would just know we're gonna pee and we're gonna-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:50:05] Yeah but we'd have to sync up. We would need someone to be the alpha bladder and someone to be the beta bladder.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:50:11] Oh god. Now you do sound like Dwight. All right, let's take a break. All right, we're back. Jan has called Michael to tell him he needs to get a hold of his employees and do a better job because they are going behind his back to her, right?

JENNA FISCHER [00:50:27] Yes. And Michael cannot believe that Dwight would try to turn his ex-lover-ish against him.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:50:33] One of my favorite lines, and it's probably because of how earnestly Steve says it, as Michael, is when Jan calls him and he says, "You were at the dentist"? Michael thinks that she randomly ran into Dwight, where he was getting his crown removed. No, Michael, it's all a lie.

JENNA FISCHER [00:50:55] Yes. Oh, yes, I love it so much. Well, Angela, then we move into the kitchen where Pam is modeling her new top for Kelly.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:51:05] Fashion Show.

JENNA FISCHER [00:51:05] And Phyllis. This is the fashion show. And then Roy walks in with a soda. And he is, oh, I, Pam's like taking his breath away right here.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:51:17] Poor Roy. Also, what is there not a vending machine in the warehouse? Come on. In that whole warehouse there's not a vending machine. You've got to come up to the office three times for a soda?

JENNA FISCHER [00:51:28] Well, you know what? That line was improved by Mindy.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:51:31] Oh, way to go, Mindy.

JENNA FISCHER [00:51:32] Isn't that so good? Yes. She had that same thought, right? Like, oh, third soda of the day. In the script as he's walking out the kitchen door. She was just supposed to say, "Awkward".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:51:45] Oh, nice.

JENNA FISCHER [00:51:47] All right. So when we go back to Stamford, Josh puts the game on hold. He calls Andy and Jim into the conference room. Jim is like, oh, finally, we're doing work. No. No. He wants to devise a strategy for the game. So speaking of improvisation, Ed had a bunch of improv at the end of this scene. So when he calls Jim a saboteur.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:52:12] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:52:12] That was improvised. That was not in the script. And then when he says all that stuff where he's like, "I am going to kill you for real. This game is over. I am really going to shoot you". Like all of that, that was that was Ed improv.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:52:25] Well, in the DVD commentary, John said that this scene was maybe one of the hardest that he had to work not to break. He said that Chip and Ed. Chip, who plays Josh, were just crushing it. And he said he was having the toughest time. So I kind of want to rewatch it to watch his face. But lady, I have a little trivia about Rainn and Chip. Chip who plays Josh.

JENNA FISCHER [00:52:50] Oh, what is it?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:52:51] OK. So did you know that Rain and Chip were in an NBC pilot in 1999. It was called "The Expendables". Now Rainn mentioned this in the DVD commentary and I had to do a deep dive. I was like what?

JENNA FISCHER [00:53:09] Oh my. It sounds like a superhero fantasy type show.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:53:14] Ok. Ready? I looked it up online. This is what I.M.D.B. had to say about it. "The Expendables" was an NBC pilot. It was about a scientist who creates two indestructible, lifelike robots. They have an affinity for television, particularly "Starsky and Hutch". Their unexpected development of emotions prompts a need for them to help people. Chip played the character Ram. Rainn played the character Newman.

JENNA FISCHER [00:53:42] Now were they, are those characters. Both the robots who developed feelings?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:53:47] They're robots.

JENNA FISCHER [00:53:47] OK.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:53:48] Yeah, and Rainn said it was so bad, but that he and Chip became friends and, and Rainn was one of the people that suggested Chip for the role of Josh.

JENNA FISCHER [00:53:57] That is some good, I would call that a tidbit and a deep dive. That's a deep tidbit. Can we go to Scranton now?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:54:05] We probably should.

JENNA FISCHER [00:54:06] This is one of my favorite all time scenes of all time on any television show ever made ever.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:54:14] This is one of my favorite bits ever.

JENNA FISCHER [00:54:16] Crentist the dentist.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:54:18] Your dentist name is Crentist?

JENNA FISCHER [00:54:21] Maybe that's why he became a dentist. It's so good.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:54:24] There is a deleted scene. There is a deleted scene where Michael Scott. Michael, he's like Scott and he starts seeing what all would name was Scott.

JENNA FISCHER [00:54:32] Yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:54:32] But he said none of them are occupations.

JENNA FISCHER [00:54:35] OK. So in the script, the Crentist dentist scene is word for word. You guys. There is nothing improvised about this scene. This was all written by Paul Lieberstein. Paul, you are a genius. It is perfection. And you're right. There's a deleted talking head and then there is even more to this scene in the script that is deleted. So if you want to see like an extended version of this genius, please visit the deleted scenes. I love it so much. We asked Rainn about it and he sent in this clip.

RAINN WILSON [00:55:11] All righty then. "Office Ladies" podcast. Jenna. Angela. Hi, it's me, Rainn Wilson. Remember me? Vaguely. Everyone talks about the Crentist scene as being so spectacular. And I know that it's some of the funniest writing. I think Paul Lieberstein wrote it. In all of "The Office", the dentist Crentist and that jousting between me and Michael. But the scene afterwards where Dwight and Michael play this chess game and Michael pretends to give up his position to Dwight is absolutely masterful. And I think Steve is, I mean, he's great and everything, but he just kills it and it's just subtle and underplayed. And I love how "Game of Thrones" it is. I forgot that this whole episode is that these power plays, power ploys, and who's going behind who's back? It's like Little Finger and Belarus and, in, you know, in high garden or whatever, I think of getting all the "Game of Thrones" names wrong. But in the red keep, all the maneuvering, you know, the Lannisters and backstabbing and loyalty and you don't know who's side who's on. And it's so fantastic. But the thing that gets me every time is that the reason it all falls apart is that Dwight insults the Sebring and ultimately the Sebring is the hinge, is the lynch pin. And it all falls apart because of the Sebring. But this episode was so well written, I remember there's sometimes when you just are like, it's just best to sit back and play the lines and have fun with them as much as possible. And I think this was one of those. And I often felt that way about Paul Liberstain's writing. It's very specific. And it was made worse through improvisation. Not better. Sometimes the writing could benefit from some kind of actors bringing their mojo, but it was not that way with "The Coup".

JENNA FISCHER [00:57:23] There you have it.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:57:24] You know, I was screaming back at him even though he couldn't hear me because it was recorded audio clip. I love that you brought up Little Finger. I love it so much. Because Rainn, I love "Game of Thrones" too. And-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:57:43] I know.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:57:44] I am Cersei. Angela is Cersei. In this episode she's Cersei. All right.

JENNA FISCHER [00:57:51] Well, Rainn brought up the scene where they're in Michael's office and Michael turns the tables on Dwight and it all falls apart.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:58:01] It is-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:58:01] And I have to agree and rewatching this, Crentist is so funny. But this dance between Steve and Rain and how they perform this scene, I think Rainn is right. Like, this is like, this is just like amazing acting and performance and writing. That scene.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:58:19] It's all genius. It is all amazing. I watched this episode three times and I could watch it again just for that scene. It is so good. And one of the things they talked about in the DVD commentary, and I actually remember this, is Greg really wanted to live in the pauses. He wasn't afraid at all to let them take their time because he wanted it to have that kind of weight to it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:58:45] Yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:58:45] And it just played so beautifully.

JENNA FISCHER [00:58:49] We had a lot of questions about improvisation, I think, because these scenes are so well performed. People think that they were improvised. So we had Carolyn Tufte wrote in about Michael's talking head, where he's talking about businesses like a jungle and he's the tiger. She wanted to know if Steve improvised any of that. Nope, all scripted. Jerry Shue wrote in to say around 14 minutes, 40 seconds, Dwight calls Michael Mike.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:59:18] Yes.

JENNA FISCHER [00:59:19] As they're getting ready to go out to the bullpen. And he said, "I think this is the only time that Dwight ever called Michael Mike in the entire show. Would you happen to know why"? That was scripted. And it's scripted because Dwight thinks he has all the power now. So he is calling him Mike as a way to kind of demote him?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:59:42] Oh, yeah, no, he's doing that thing where you give people nicknames to sort of put them in their place. And it is so brilliant because, you know, he is also taking the power away. Michael's like, should we go out there? And he goes, when I'm ready, Mike.

JENNA FISCHER [00:59:57] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:59:58] It's brilliant.

JENNA FISCHER [01:00:00] Well, when Michael does break the news to everyone. Oh, Angela, you are so pleased. So pleased. Stanley has a lot of questions. Phyllis asks Michael what he plans to do. And Kevin is very concerned that Michael's going to lose his condo. Rainn had a little something to say about this scene too, Angela. Let's play this clip.

RAINN WILSON [01:00:21] Angela, your reaction, the tiniest hint of a smile, of the Lady Macbeth smile that you gave Dwight during when he's announcing, the few of you that will be left during my reign. I'm gonna lead you into the black with ferocity. Your little look there is fantastic. And Jenna, I love your line about the vacuum cleaner being as capable a manager as Dwight. It was so much fun to shoot. It's so much fun to relive this with you guys. Maybe one day you'll have me actually back on the show again. Maybe. Maybe the global pandemic has gotten in the way of that a little bit. I'm so glad for what you're doing with this show. I'm so happy, even though I haven't heard any of the episodes and I probably never will. But I'm really happy for you because I like you both and you seem like you're having fun. That's all I have to say. I love you both. Goodbye.

JENNA FISCHER [01:01:22] Oh, Rainn.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:01:22] That made me laugh.

JENNA FISCHER [01:01:24] You guys, that is Rainn in a nutshell.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:01:26] Yes.

JENNA FISCHER [01:01:26] He is our curmudgeon with a big heart. And I love him so much. I love him so much. We're gonna figure this out and we're gonna get him on.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:01:35] Yes, Rainn, I love you. You tall, geeky man, you.

JENNA FISCHER [01:01:42] But this is true, Angela. I love how delighted your character is by this new shift in power. I love that when you're alone and you guys talk about it, he tells you that you can be in control of the women and you're very pleased about that as well.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:01:58] Well, this now starts a series of talking heads, right? Because everyone is reacting to this news. I am, of course, delighted. My character's delighted. So Phyllis has a talking head that I love so much. Right? She says maybe I'll quit. But if you look at the deleted scenes, this goes on for a bit. And this is such a great line.

JENNA FISCHER [01:02:15] Oh, yes, Angela. Yes, yes. Share this, share this.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:02:18] OK, so she says that her fiancé says after they get married, she doesn't even need to work anymore, that her new job is going to be being Mrs. Bob Vance, the first lady of Vance Refrigeration.

JENNA FISCHER [01:02:31] Yes, I love that so much. I love that so much.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:02:35] That was so, so cute.

JENNA FISCHER [01:02:36] And by the way, you see her play that role like you see her take on being the first lady of Vance Refrigeration as this relationship plays out over the series.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:02:48] Yeah, it's really fun to watch. And at 15 minutes, 50 seconds now, we have that Dwight tells Angela that she can be in charge of the women.

JENNA FISCHER [01:02:58] Yes, she's a little annoyed because I think she was like, we can do so many great things here. And he's like, there can only be one person in charge.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:03:07] But then as soon as he gives her a job that she gets to have control over people, she's OK with it. OK, fine.

JENNA FISCHER [01:03:12] Yeah. She accepts it.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:03:12] OK, fine. I'll be in charge of the women, I remember doing the scene and I was kind of struggling with that final look and what my expression was. And Greg gave me direction. He said, Angela, I want you to imagine what you'll do to the other women.

JENNA FISCHER [01:03:29] Oh, my God.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:03:33] So that was the look I had.

JENNA FISCHER [01:03:35] That's amazing. That is amazing.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:03:38] So now we're back at Fancy Stamford. And Karen is making fun of Jim's lack of "Call of Duty" skills. Right? He's not very good at it, but she's just sort of smiling through it and just, she's clearly a little smitten. Sam.

STING [01:03:53] Flirty Karen.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:03:54] Yeah. I talked to my mom about it. I talked to Birdie Kinsey. Birdie said that's flirty Karen.

JENNA FISCHER [01:04:04] Oh Angela, I love it so much. I love it that you made your mom say, "Flirty Karen".

ANGELA KINSEY [01:04:09] It took a minute. I had to explain everything. She was like, what am I doing? And then I told her what Karen was up to and she said, well, she is being flirty. So this is flirty Karen, guys. Karen is putting on the flirt. And-.

JENNA FISCHER [01:04:23] Yes, this is what I was talking about in my Fast Fact. This is what got everybody very, very, very upset.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:04:30] Yes. And then on a side note, Rashida said in the DVD commentary that this was her audition scene.

JENNA FISCHER [01:04:37] Oh, really? This was a scene she had to audition with.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:04:40] So she really knew the scene well.

JENNA FISCHER [01:04:42] Well, I want you to know something. This is jumping ahead a little bit. But I just want to say, to wrap up this storyline of the Jim Karen flirt, you know, at the end of this, when Jim is packing up for the night and Karen's watching and he throws the fake grenade at her. This is now kind of like their first inside joke. That scene was not in the script. That was added later. We saw that Karen is kind of sweet on Jim a little bit. Right? In the scene you're talking about. But they wanted to see Jim give her a little of, a little Halpert.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:05:18] Mmhmm. Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [01:05:19] We wanted to see a little bit go her way. And so they added that scene to show that there was a real connection between them. A playfulness, if you will.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:05:28] Well, it worked. We have to talk about the most uncomfortable groveling I've ever witnessed and Rainn in true Rainn fashion. 18 minutes, 25 seconds, begins to beg. Beg Michael. And, and Michael is just watching him. He gets on the ground. He kind of shoves his butt in the air. Then he lays flat on the ground. And then at 19 minutes, 11 seconds. Jenna. Jenna. The drool.

JENNA FISCHER [01:06:01] Yeah, we got letters about the drool, Angela. Letters about the drool.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:06:05] It is so disgusting. It comes out then he sucks it back in.

JENNA FISCHER [01:06:11] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:06:11] Then he kind of swallows it. Then he hugs Michael hard.

JENNA FISCHER [01:06:16] Yeah. Yeah. So all that stuff on the ground and the hugging and all of that. That was all scripted. The drool was just on the day. That was.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:06:27] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [01:06:28] There was no scripted drool.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:06:30] All Rainn. But Rainn is right in his little clip when he said it's the Sebring that breaks Michael. It is so brilliant when he's like, "Take it back. That's my car"!

JENNA FISCHER [01:06:40] Yes. Yes. Oh, my gosh. Well, you know, when Michael tells Dwight to stand up and hug it out, bitch. We had a fan question from Kristin Bauer. She said, "That line, 'Hug it out, bitch' is one of my favorite lines in the whole show and it cracks me up. Who came up with that line"? Well, Kristin, this is a famous line from the show "Entourage", which we set up earlier, that Michael loves. Jeremy Piven character, Ari Gold, would say it all the time. This was in the script. This was a callback. And I got curious about it though, Angela and I watched an interview last night with Jeremy Piven and he said he was talking about improvisation on the set of "Entourage". And he said, we really did not improvise. We really didn't. He said it was very, very, very, very rare to improvise. But he said occasionally they did. And the thing about improvisation he was saying was like, if you are in your character, then you will say something that your character would say. It's not about necessarily trying to be funny or clever. It's just about saying that next thing that your character would honestly say in the moment, he said that the line, "Hug it out, bitch" was an improvisation. This famous line, he said it was crazy because we rarely did it, but there was this scene that he was in and his character was trying to comfort another character. And so he just improvised, "Let's hug it out, bitch". Isn't that crazy?

ANGELA KINSEY [01:08:12] I love that that was an improvised line because it sums up his character, his character, Ari, just perfectly. This is an amazing callback, which I love as an improviser. I know, Rainn, if you're listening, you're making fun of me right now. But as an improviser, I live for a callback. So I love that they set up "Entourage" at the beginning and they bring this subtle reference back at the end.

JENNA FISCHER [01:08:32] Well, now the episode really wraps up with Michael and Dwight. They're back in the conference room. They're watching a movie together. Angela, you walk by. You're not pleased. But listen, this is how it had to be.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:08:44] He chose Michael once again. I feel like Dwight is torn between Angela and Michael for years. And then finally, it goes her way because he leaves.

JENNA FISCHER [01:08:54] Well, Michael has his final talking head where he says they hugged it out. He's still angry. So he did make Dwight stand in the middle of the office with a sign around his neck that says "Liar". And Dwight has to do Michael's laundry for a year. And that's where we leave it.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:09:09] Before we wrap up, I have two little things to share with you guys. I did write in my journal about this episode, and I only wrote about one thing. All right. So Jenna, I wrote that I did a different talking head that didn't make it in the show. And I said I thought it was so funny, but maybe it was just too long. But Angela Martin says that she has a friend who has introduced her to a show called "Star Trek". And in "Star Trek", there is a guy named Spock, and he's very honorable and brave and he stands up for what he thinks is right. And she just wishes that someone in the office could be more like Spock. And I just thought it was really cute that it's a window into their lives that Dwight is teaching her about "Star Trek". And what she'd never heard of "Star Trek"?

JENNA FISCHER [01:09:53] Yeah, it's this little show you probably have not heard of it called "Star Trek".

ANGELA KINSEY [01:09:57] Yeah. Here it is. So that deleted scene is not on the DVD extras, guys. I don't know where that lives, but I did a whole talking head about "Star Trek". But there is a deleted scene. I have to share with you and I will leave you with this, Jenna. This is on the DVD extras. We find out that Creed sleeps under his desk four nights a week and then he goes to his place in Toronto.

JENNA FISCHER [01:10:22] Yeah. Yeah, I love that.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:10:25] What?

JENNA FISCHER [01:10:27] When I was re-reading the script, I read that and I actually remember Creed shooting that. And it was so funny. And I remember Paul cracking up while they were shooting that because he was so tickled by the idea that Creed slept under his desk.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:10:43] Yeah. So-.

JENNA FISCHER [01:10:44] This is why he doesn't have a refrigerator, where-.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:10:47] Oh my god, he's never had his own refrigerator.

JENNA FISCHER [01:10:50] He's never had his own refrigerator because he sleeps under his desk.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:10:54] Four nights a week.

JENNA FISCHER [01:10:56] I love it.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:10:57] And then what is his whole second life in Toronto? I am so intrigued.
