OFFICE LADIES | EPISODE 26 - DRUG TESTING

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:04] I'm Jenna Fischer.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:05] I'm Angela Kinsey.

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:06] We were on "The Office" together.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:07] And we're best friends.

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:08] And now we're doing the Ultimate Office re-watch podcast just for you.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:12] Each week we will break down an episode of "The Office" and give exclusive behind the scenes stories that only two people who were there can tell you.

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:19] We're the "Office Ladies". Good morning.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:24] Good morning, folks.

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:25] Welcome to your "Drug Testing". Season 2, Episode 20. Written by Jen Celotta and directed by Greg Daniels. What a team.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:35] Such a great duo.

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:37] Here's a little summary of this episode: Dwight finds half a joint in the Dunder Mifflin parking lot. He launches an investigation.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:47] Oh, man.

JENNA FISCHER [00:00:48] Very elaborate investigation.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:00:51] He is like a kid in a candy jar. In the DVD commentary, Jen, who wrote this episode, said they were very curious about what would happen if we got to see Dwight in action, in his uniform. You know, the Lackawanna sheriff uniform.

JENNA FISCHER [00:01:06] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:07] And really investigating. And this was something they had on a card on the wall was like "Dwight in uniform comes to office. What happens"?

JENNA FISCHER [00:01:17] Oh, well, this is what happens, guys.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:20] Yeah. This is happens.

JENNA FISCHER [00:01:21] This episode is what happens. Also in this episode, Pam jinxes Jim, who then can't talk for the entire day until he buys her a Coke.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:31] Because he's clearly in love with her because what grown man would do that? You have to suspend belief a little bit.

JENNA FISCHER [00:01:39] We got a few questions about what is jinx.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:42] Really?

JENNA FISCHER [00:01:42] People weren't as totally familiar with the jinx or the rule of jinx. It's a it's a kid game where if you say something at the same time as someone.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:01:50] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:01:50] You just say "Jinx" and then the person can't talk. Now my kids play it. The way they play it is you have to say their name five times and then they're un-jinxed.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:02:00] I grew up playing it exactly the way Jim and Pam play it. "Jinx. Buy me a coke".

JENNA FISCHER [00:02:04] Really?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:02:05] The exact same way.

JENNA FISCHER [00:02:06] Oh, see, I grew up with it, "Jinx". And then you have to wait till someone says your name three or five times.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:02:11] Yeah. No, this was exactly how, like, I knew the game to be played.

JENNA FISCHER [00:02:15] Wow. All right. Well, there you go. All right. Should we get into some Fast Facts?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:02:20] Let's do it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:02:21] Fast Fact Number One: this was the last episode we shot before leaving for summer hiatus break.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:02:28] Yes. I have this in my journal, guys. I have some good journals, stuff that I'm going to like sprinkle through this. But yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:02:35] So if you notice, this is a really big Dwight episode.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:02:39] Yes.

JENNA FISCHER [00:02:40] Big Dwight storyline. Steve needed to get off early to film a movie over his summer hiatus. So Steve only worked one day this week and Kent Zbornak, our line producer, who, by the way, is my new source for info.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:02:55] Kent, thank you. And I, Jenna has told me she's hitting you up a lot and you always have a speedy reply. And she loves that.

JENNA FISCHER [00:03:02] I do. It's a speedy reply. And it's a meaty reply.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:03:06] Speedy and meaty.

JENNA FISCHER [00:03:07] That's right. That's what she said.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:03:10] Oh, you don't want speedy meaty. Oh, no. Oh, lord. We're gonna get that E again. OK.

JENNA FISCHER [00:03:16] Well, I told Kent I'm gonna start calling him Kent-apedia.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:03:19] Kent-apedia! I love that.

JENNA FISCHER [00:03:22] Kent-apedia.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:03:22] Oh, that's good.

JENNA FISCHER [00:03:23] So I went to Kent-apedia and he told me that the day that Steve worked, we shot 14 pages of material. I feel like I need to give some context to that. That is a huge amount.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:03:36] That's so much.

JENNA FISCHER [00:03:38] So every page of a script generally equals one minute of screen time. So if a script is one hundred and twenty pages, that movie will come in around one hundred and twenty minutes. And so our scripts were usually around 35, 40 pages.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:03:57] They'd have to trim that.

JENNA FISCHER [00:03:58] Down to 22 minutes. Imagine if you shot, like we were shoot, we shot like, what is that like 25, 30 percent.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:08] Of the episode in one day.

JENNA FISCHER [00:04:09] One day. We usually had five days.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:12] That was a marathon day.

JENNA FISCHER [00:04:14] Marathon day.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:15] Well, I wrote in my journal that this was our last episode of the season and we were all sort of giddy and that the accounting department, me, Brian and Oscar, the fake accounting department, you guys, we chipped in and got a coffee cart that came to the set.

JENNA FISCHER [00:04:30] Oh yeah!

ANGELA KINSEY [00:04:30] We were really excited and we made a sign and everything because we would do this at the end of the season. Cast members would get together and give gifts to the cast and crew. And so the accounting department chipped in. We got everyone coffee and also Jenna, I have in here that you were very excited this week because you've got a Roomba. And I wrote that down. I was like "Jenna got a Roomba. It sounds really cool".

JENNA FISCHER [00:04:57] You know what? I went on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" and I offhandedly made a comment about how I had really wanted a Roomba for Christmas and didn't get it or some story to this effect.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:13] Right.

JENNA FISCHER [00:05:13] And then I also told a story that I loved horror movies. Like two weeks later, the Roomba people sent me a zombie Roomba.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:26] That's crazy.

JENNA FISCHER [00:05:27] It was a Roomba with a special zombie design on it. And I will tell you what, I was giddy. I must have just gone around talking about that Roomba.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:36] I remember your zombie Roomba.

JENNA FISCHER [00:05:38] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:39] I thought it was creepy.

JENNA FISCHER [00:05:41] I love it.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:42] It clean the heck out of your floors.

JENNA FISCHER [00:05:44] It sure did.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:45] We are not, we're not sponsored by Roomba, guys.

JENNA FISCHER [00:05:47] We are not. I had a dog and a cat, and I was so grateful for that little Roomba. Go around, get all the animal hair.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:05:53] Well, and then in the DVD commentary, I want you to know that the writers talked about how they felt like Pam was extra peppy in this episode. She hops. She kind of skips. She bounces up and down during a talking head. You know, there's all these little moments and they were like, "Do you think it's because Jenna knew she was about start vacation"?

JENNA FISCHER [00:06:12] I think it was.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:13] You were just excited cause you're like, "Woohoo"!

JENNA FISCHER [00:06:15] We were all in a good mood.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:17] We were.

JENNA FISCHER [00:06:17] We were we were kids anticipating our summer break, it was hard to keep us concentrated on our schoolwork.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:23] It was just like that.

JENNA FISCHER [00:06:24] Well, here's something that blows my mind when I think about this fact of shooting it last. That means that John and I had already filmed the "Casino Night" kiss.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:36] Oh, yeah?

JENNA FISCHER [00:06:38] We filmed that already.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:39] Because we shot out of order.

JENNA FISCHER [00:06:41] Yeah. And so we, we had to like go back and erase that from our character's memory.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:46] Yeah, that hadn't happened.

JENNA FISCHER [00:06:47] When we shot this episode.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:06:48] Before we go to Fast Fact Number Two. The other thing is, this was the week, I wrote a lot about this episode. This was also the week I brought my own camera. That was black and white. I brought, I bought black and white film and I took a ton of photos. I have all these great pictures of Rainn in this Lackawanna sherrif, with the black like tall boots, in black and white.

JENNA FISCHER [00:07:13] Well, I know what we're doing with those photos, lady.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:07:15] I know what we're doing with them, too.

JENNA FISCHER [00:07:17] I don't know if you're allowed to say yet.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:07:19] I know but it's gonna be really exciting and you guys are gonna love it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:07:22] Yeah. We have been a little bit talking about it.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:07:26] Yeah, we're working on something.

JENNA FISCHER [00:07:28] On something.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:07:28] We're working on something to share those pictures with you.

JENNA FISCHER [00:07:30] That's right.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:07:31] Okay.

JENNA FISCHER [00:07:32] All right. Fast Fact Number Two: speaking of Dwight's uniform, we got a lot of questions about that. So fan question from Bailey Lawson, "Was Dwight's volunteer uniform copied from the actual Scranton uniforms"? I went to Kent-apedia.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:07:48] Good.

JENNA FISCHER [00:07:49] And he said that the sheriff's costume was authentic to Pennsylvania. That Carey Bennett, our wardrobe designer, she had done a lot of research on it, but they did take some liberties. The hat and the boots, those were generally worn by the Pennsylvania state troopers. The Pennsylvania sheriffs wore different hat and shoes. But we thought, I don't know.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:08:11] They wanted to give Dwight that power. In the DVD commentary, Jen talks about her love of this hat. She loved him in this hat so much. Her and Greg both did. That they kept wanting him to wear it. So you'll see in the episode, there'll be scenes without him in the hat and scenes with him in the hat. And then they also told hair and makeup, when he would take the hat off, they would go try to fix his hair. And they're like, "No, no, no. He needs to look like he has hat head".

JENNA FISCHER [00:08:34] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:08:35] So if you look at Dwight's hair in this it's kind of smushed down because they wanted it to look like he had just taken his hat off.

JENNA FISCHER [00:08:42] I love that. I think that's, I love that detail about our show.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:08:44] I do too. And Rainn in the DVD commentary said he noticed a difference in how the ladies acted around him. This week in this uniform, he said all of the ladies acted it a little differently.

JENNA FISCHER [00:08:56] Huh.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:08:58] Huh. So there you go.

JENNA FISCHER [00:08:58] We'll have to get him in here to give us more details on that. So Fast Fact Number Three is not about this episode. It's not about "Game of Thrones" either. I just want to say that.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:08] OK.

JENNA FISCHER [00:09:09] This is inspired by some fan mail that we got. It made me want to speak about the Michael Scotts of the world.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:17] I have no idea where you're going.

JENNA FISCHER [00:09:20] OK.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:20] I'm here for it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:09:21] Well, I got this letter. IJinxedM33.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:26] OK.

JENNA FISCHER [00:09:26] Wrote in to say, "Trivia. There was a character on 'Young and the Restless' named Michael Scott. He was locked in the basement by Victor Newman".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:37] Oh, Victor Newman was so evil.

JENNA FISCHER [00:09:39] So I looked it up. And yes, from 1981 to 82, there was this character named Michael Scott. He was played by actor Nicolas Benedict. So Michael Scott was a photographer and he had an affair.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:53] What?

JENNA FISCHER [00:09:53] With Victor's first wife, Julia.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:09:55] And so Victor locked him in a basement?

JENNA FISCHER [00:09:57] Yeah, he locked him in his bomb shelter.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:10:01] Well Victor-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:10:01] Which was in the basement.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:10:02] Victor was a very wealthy man. He probably had a whole bunker.

JENNA FISCHER [00:10:06] Well, listen to what he did, though.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:10:08] Why do I know all this about "Young and the Restless"? OK, go.

JENNA FISCHER [00:10:10] Did you watch it?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:10:11] My grandmother did. Her stories. But she wouldn't admit to it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:10:14] Oh.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:10:14] She'd say, she'd say, "I don't even care anything about that". But she'd leave it on all day and watch, and her stories would be playing in the background.

JENNA FISCHER [00:10:21] So I watched "All My Children", my mom watched "All My Children" when she nursed me. And then she, she said that's how she got into it, was that it was on when it was time to nurse me as a baby. And then she watched it. I kind of grew up watching it with her. Right? And then when I went to college, I arranged my class schedule so that I could be home to watch "All My Children", because it was on at noon. It was on ABC. Kelly Ripa was on it, by the way.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:10:52] Oh, yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:10:52] And, you know, we didn't have what we have now. We didn't have this like digital recording stuff.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:10:58] No. If you, if you missed it, you missed it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:11:00] You missed it. Well, listen to what Victor Newman did to poor Michael Scott in the basement.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:11:04] Oh, no, Victor.

JENNA FISCHER [00:11:05] He fed him baked rats.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:11:09] Ew! Victor.

JENNA FISCHER [00:11:10] Yeah. He also put in like a live video feed so that Michael Scott had to watch Victor make love to Julia.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:11:18] Wow. That is twisted.

JENNA FISCHER [00:11:20] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:11:21] I want to be in the writers room at "Young and the Restless". I want to see what's on their, their cards on the wall.

JENNA FISCHER [00:11:28] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:11:29] "Michael Scott in basement". "Eats rats".

JENNA FISCHER [00:11:31] Well, eventually, Julia discovered what was going on and she freed him.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:11:36] Good.

JENNA FISCHER [00:11:37] Yeah. So he's not, he made it out alive.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:11:39] But he was there for years?

JENNA FISCHER [00:11:41] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:11:42] Wow.

JENNA FISCHER [00:11:43] OK, so. Next, Michael Scott, remember that bobblehead? That was in the vending machine at the beginning of "Booze Cruise" in the cold open?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:11:53] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:11:53] We talked about it. OK.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:11:55] 'Cause, 'cause is this when they put all of Dwight's things in the vending machine? This is the prank.

JENNA FISCHER [00:12:00] Yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:12:00] Jim's prank on Dwight.

JENNA FISCHER [00:12:01] Yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:12:02] Got it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:12:02] And you mentioned, "Oh, I think there's a Phillies' bobblehead in there".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:12:06] There is a Phillies' baseball player in there.

JENNA FISCHER [00:12:07] Yeah. Well, Jake Lauer and Penguins :ovely wrote in to say, "The bobblehead in the vending machine is a baseball player named Mike Leberthal". But get this. His name is Michael Scott Liberthal.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:12:19] No, no.

JENNA FISCHER [00:12:22] Michael Scott.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:12:23] I even looked that up. I didn't come across the middle name.

JENNA FISCHER [00:12:25] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:12:26] Wow.

JENNA FISCHER [00:12:27] Another Michael Scott. All right. Here's my last Michael Scott for you.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:12:31] OK.

JENNA FISCHER [00:12:32] There's a famous Irish writer named Michael Scott, and he writes science fiction. Angela, you'd like him. Fantasy, horror. He's written over 100 books and he's maybe most famous for the series called "The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flannel". But in all my reading about him, I am pretty sure his life has been made completely miserable by the character of Michael Scott.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:12:57] Well, yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:12:58] Because he's like this accomplished novelist, who was very famous, and then when this man was like around 60 or 65 years old, a television show called "The Office" came around and turned his name into a joke. So we're very sorry, Irish writer Michael Scott.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:13:17] But I hope now people go check out your books.

JENNA FISCHER [00:13:20] Yeah. Well, there we go. I needed to give him a plug. They're, I mean, they were at the top of The New York Times bestseller list and all so.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:13:26] Oh, I want to check them out.

JENNA FISCHER [00:13:27] Yeah, it's good stuff.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:13:27] I'd probably love them.

JENNA FISCHER [00:13:28] Yeah. All right. Well, that's it. That's all I got for my Fast Facts.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:13:32] That, those were really good Fast Facts. I think we had a good time in that section.

JENNA FISCHER [00:13:36] Thank you. Well, we'll take a break. But, guys, today is our first episode that includes a State Farm real deal moment.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:13:48] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:13:48] Stay tuned for that.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:13:49] It's a good one. All right, let's get into this episode, Jenna. I have something right away at 43 seconds. Dwight starts his interrogation.

JENNA FISCHER [00:13:59] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:00] First one up is Kevin.

JENNA FISCHER [00:14:01] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:02] And he says, "Here are the symptoms of marijuana use".

JENNA FISCHER [00:14:06] Mmhmm.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:06] Tell me if any of these remind you of someone. Number one, slow moving. Two, inattentive. Three, dull. Four, constantly snacking. Five, shows a lack of motivation. Kevin responds, "Hey".

JENNA FISCHER [00:14:22] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:23] OK. There, OK. There is a blooper that I had never seen. I've watched a lot of these bloopers now. Right?

JENNA FISCHER [00:14:30] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:30]  And they're sort of different come compilations of them on YouTube. I don't know how I missed it, but there is a blooper where Kevin is talking to you up front reception.

JENNA FISCHER [00:14:40] Uh huh.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:41] And he goes, "He said I was dull". And you can't get through it. You keep laughing.

JENNA FISCHER [00:14:47] I could not do Kevin scenes. Brian made me laugh so hard all the time.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:53] All, you had no lines.

JENNA FISCHER [00:14:55] No.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:14:55] All he said was, "He said I was dull". And you, you couldn't, you couldn't even look at him.

JENNA FISCHER [00:15:00] I remember that. I remember shooting that.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:02] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:15:03] Because I don't think we got it. I think the reason it's not in the episode is we never got a take of it. I couldn't do it.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:08] I mean, I don't doubt it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:15:10] That happen sometimes.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:11] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:15:11] Sometimes they were like, "You know what? It's a wash".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:13] Nevermind.

JENNA FISCHER [00:15:14] Just leave it alone.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:14] We have enough. We have enough. And then Dwight in a talking head right after says, "I like the people I work with, with the exception of four, four people".

JENNA FISCHER [00:15:22] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:22] Who are those four people?

JENNA FISCHER [00:15:23] We got a lot of mail about that.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:25] Oh, yeah. Well, would you, would you find?

JENNA FISCHER [00:15:28] I, I don't know. People wanted, people wanted us to name the four people that we think are the four people. With the exception of four people.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:36] Who do you think? Who do you think?

JENNA FISCHER [00:15:37] Who do I think he does like or doesn't like?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:39] No. He says he likes everyone with the exception of four.

JENNA FISCHER [00:15:43] Who do I think he doesn't like? I think he doesn't like Jim.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:48] Oh, I. Jim is number one on the list for me.

JENNA FISCHER [00:15:51] I think he doesn't like Creed.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:56] I would say, Toby, just because Michael hates-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:15:58] Michael doesn't like Toby.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:15:59] Michael hates Toby and Dwight loves Michael.

JENNA FISCHER [00:16:01] He might. Well, he likes Pam. We know that.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:16:04] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:16:05] He's got a soft spot for Pam.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:16:06] I think he thinks Pam's decent.

JENNA FISCHER [00:16:08] Maybe Ryan and Kelly.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:16:11] Maybe Ryan the temp because he's competition.

JENNA FISCHER [00:16:13] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:16:13] To him. And then maybe because he's competitive, maybe one of the other sales reps. I don't know.

JENNA FISCHER [00:16:20] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:16:21] All right. There you go.

JENNA FISCHER [00:16:23] We don't know though. We don't know who the four people are. They were never written down. That's one of those fun little things that we just give you to think about.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:16:31] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:16:31] The writers.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:16:31] You tell us who you think.

JENNA FISCHER [00:16:32] Yeah. So now we're in the kitchen and Jim does an impression of Stanley.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:16:38] Yes.

JENNA FISCHER [00:16:39] Followed by a Pam talking head doing an impression of Phyllis.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:16:43] Mmhmm.

JENNA FISCHER [00:16:43] Tina Kakalick, McKayla Maroney and Katie Coles all asked this question, "Did the writers know that John could do impressions of Stanley ahead of time? Or did they just write it and hope he could do it"? Guys, John Krasinski's impressions were known and legendary.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:02] Guys, we were like 20 episodes in by now and we were all hanging out a lot. And in between scenes or when we were killing time and goofing off, John would do these impressions and we loved them.

JENNA FISCHER [00:17:12] John could be one of those "Saturday Night Live" people who does impressions of people like he is an amazing mimic.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:20] Yes.

JENNA FISCHER [00:17:20] The writers knew.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:21] The writers knew. It's on the DVD commentary, too. They talk about it about how great he is with impressions.

JENNA FISCHER [00:17:26] I am horrible at impressions.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:28] You made me laugh really hard with your Phyllis impression. And then here's something I thought was so clever is your talking head is by the kitchen door that has a window and over your shoulder you can see Phyllis and Jim.

JENNA FISCHER [00:17:41] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:42] Which is-, Pam has some interesting talking heads, location wise, in this episode.

JENNA FISCHER [00:17:46] I agree.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:47] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:17:47] I, that was that was planned.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:49] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:17:49] They wanted you to see them in the background.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:51] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:17:52] Yeah. Instead of in the chair.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:17:53] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:17:54] Where I normally sit. But if you watch the deleted scenes you can see John doing impressions of more people. So if you want more, you can have more. And they're great.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:04] They're great. He does several of their like members of "The Office".

JENNA FISCHER [00:18:07] At 2 minutes, 19 seconds were in the conference room. Dwight is interrogating Kelly. I swear it looks like Rainn is gonna break at any moment.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:16] Well, they could not get through this scene. I remember this like so vividly. Mindy was like on the floor. She had disintegrated. And if you watch the scene when he goes, "Your ass is on the line. My ass is on the line". It barely cuts to Mindy. It's so quick because she couldn't get through it. That might be the only reaction they have where she isn't just giggling.

JENNA FISCHER [00:18:40] Yeah. I feel like Rainn is about to lose it right after he says, "This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:51] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:18:51] Like he has to purse his lips a little bit.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:53] Uh huh.

JENNA FISCHER [00:18:54] I want you to notice something in the scene, by the way.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:56] What?

JENNA FISCHER [00:18:57] Mindy's hair is up.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:18:59] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:19:00] In kind of a twisty thing. It's a stylish twist.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:03] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:19:03] Do you know why her hair is up?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:06] Is it because she got extensions?

JENNA FISCHER [00:19:07] For "Casino Night" and we shot "Casino Night" before this.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:11] She's also wearing like a colorful shirt. But then like this pink sweater shawl thing, like a-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:19:16] A very fuzzy shawl.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:18] Half sweater thing.

JENNA FISCHER [00:19:19] Like an angora sweater thing.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:20] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:19:21] Yeah. But anyway, that's why her hair is it's longer continuity.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:26] That's real good.

JENNA FISCHER [00:19:27] So next up, Dwight goes over to Ryan. He says, "I want to search your car. Give me your keys. I want to search your car". And-.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:35] Ryan's like, "No".

JENNA FISCHER [00:19:37] He's like, "No, you can't search my car".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:39] And then Dwight's like, "You want to do this the easy way or the hard way"?

JENNA FISCHER [00:19:42] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:42] Ryan's like, "OK, what's the hard way"?

JENNA FISCHER [00:19:44] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:19:44] He's like, "I go down I get-", it's like multiple steps. And Ryan's like, "Yeah, I'll do it that way". Like, he's so cocky. But through this whole exchange in the background is Angela Martin. And she has the smuggiest look. She's so proud. She's like, "Oh, he will destroy you, Ryan". She's so like turned on by Dwight being this dude.

JENNA FISCHER [00:20:11] I have from Robbie Austin.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:14] Uh huh.

JENNA FISCHER [00:20:14] He wrote in a sass catch.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:17] Oh.

JENNA FISCHER [00:20:18] He wrote in about this moment, Angela, that you're talking about. He said, "I saw the unspoken Angela sass when Dwight was talking to Ryan about his car keys".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:28] There's a lot of Angela sass, but it's kind of guys like, I don't know, like seductive sass?

JENNA FISCHER [00:20:34] Oh.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:35] It's a little-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:20:35] She's so aroused by his displays of authority.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:41] Oh, my gosh. I know. I know. You know, I watch this with my daughter and she's lik, "Mom". When I, she was like, "Why are you looking at him like that"? I was like, "Oh, honey. Fast forward".

JENNA FISCHER [00:20:52] Ok, I noticed something else in this scene with Ryan and Dwight.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:20:56] What?

JENNA FISCHER [00:20:57] On Ryan's desk, he has a framed photo on his desk. And here's the thing. It's a very decorative frame. It's like a ceramic painted frame. It almost looks like a decorative ceramic tile.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:11] Like someone, is it like someone handmade it?

JENNA FISCHER [00:21:13] Kind of.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:14] Right?

JENNA FISCHER [00:21:14] And then in the, it's a photo of just one person dressed for winter. And I zoomed in and it kinda looks like it's a photo of B.J. Like he has a photo of himself on his desk. I just-.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:30] That is hilarious.

JENNA FISCHER [00:21:31] I just found it very interesting because the character of Ryan always seems like he has like one foot out the door. And but he did take the time to put this treasured frame with a photo of maybe himself on his desk. I mean he decorated his desk.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:45] Well.

JENNA FISCHER [00:21:46] I thought that was telling.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:47] Here's my backstory. That has no, nothing to support it, you guys, this is my backstory.

JENNA FISCHER [00:21:52] Made up in your head.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:21:53] My made up in my head backstory is that Kelly gave him that frame. Kelly made that frame. That's a photo she took of him, probably against his will. And she put it in a frame and she gave it to him as a gift. And she decorated his desk because she has decided they're boyfriend girlfriend.

JENNA FISCHER [00:22:11] Oh, I like that back story.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:12] That's my backstory.

JENNA FISCHER [00:22:13] I like that. And if he takes it down, she's like, "Why did you take down my frame"?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:17] Yeah, "That was such a fun night. Remember? That was the night that you gave me a ride, remember"?

JENNA FISCHER [00:22:23] I like this story. So next, Michael comes out of his office. He walks over and he tells Dwight to take a chill pill.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:30] Take a chill pill.

JENNA FISCHER [00:22:31] Chill out. He just mocks the investigation.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:34] Well he calls him a narc.

JENNA FISCHER [00:22:36] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:36] And Dwight says, "Thank you. That is a compliment". I have a little, I have a card at 3 minutes, 58 seconds. Michael, does this whole riff, right? About being stoned but he clearly doesn't know what he's talking about. He's like, "Smoke my doobies".

JENNA FISCHER [00:22:50] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:22:50] "Doobies with my brother. Peace out, Seacrest". And you guys, do you remember when Ryan Seacrest hosted "American Idol" and he would end "American Idol" by saying "Peace out, Secrest"?

JENNA FISCHER [00:23:02] No.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:02] Or "Seacrest out"? He'd say, "Seacrest out".

JENNA FISCHER [00:23:05] I don't remember that.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:06] I so remember that. I had friends that would say it. "Seacrest out". Like when they were leaving a party, they'd be like, "Seacrest out". I'd be like, "All right, dork".

JENNA FISCHER [00:23:14] Does he say that anymore? He doesn't.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:16] I, I don't know. I don't know. But I looked up "Seacrest out", and what was hilarious to me is the first thing that comes up is Michael Scott.

JENNA FISCHER [00:23:26] Really?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:27] Yeah. "Peace out, Seacrest" And then if you scroll down, scroll down, it will say "Ryan Seacrest used to say this on American Idol".

JENNA FISCHER [00:23:34] We totally grabbed that peace of pop culture.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:23:36] We grabbed it. We grabbed it. "Seacrest out".

JENNA FISCHER [00:23:39] At 4 minutes, 8 seconds. I think it's always there. But I really noticed it in this episode. There's a shot of Michael talking to Jim and the camera is situated such that you can see the couch in the reception area. OK, there's a lamp next to the couch.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:24:00] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:24:00] Hung on the wall, but behind the lamp is a plaque. Who would hang something behind a lamp on a-?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:24:07] Oh, yeah. That's there.

JENNA FISCHER [00:24:08] What is your plaque?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:24:09] I don't know. But I've seen it, too. And it's like it's just the most misplaced like-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:24:14] Check it out 4 minutes, 8 seconds. I think it's always there, but it really stood out to me today.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:24:19] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:24:20] I don't know.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:24:21] Ok, up next, Dwight is going to interrogate Oscar.

JENNA FISCHER [00:24:24] I loved the scene.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:24:25] Yeah. I mean, Oscar visited his grandma when he was like five.

JENNA FISCHER [00:24:29] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:24:30] And now he's like maybe a potential drug mule.

JENNA FISCHER [00:24:33] Right.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:24:33] That's what Dwight thinks.

JENNA FISCHER [00:24:35] "Have you ever pooped a balloon"? That's what he asks Oscar.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:24:38] Oscar just leaves.

JENNA FISCHER [00:24:40] There's-.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:24:40] I know for a fact Rainn had to have lost it on that line. I know it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:24:45] There's a little bit of B-roll of Oscar over at accounting. That is, sort of leads into this scene in the conference room and at 4 minutes, 23 seconds, there's a shot of Oscar sitting at his desk on the phone and Angela, the dog poster, is still on the partition.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:25:01] I saw that, too.

JENNA FISCHER [00:25:02] It's still there. They didn't take it.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:25:04] They didn't take it down.

JENNA FISCHER [00:25:05] When will they take it down? Should we track it?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:25:08] Yeah. Let's track it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:25:08] Add it to the "Track it" list. Also, at 4 minutes, 58 seconds, when Oscar leaves the conference room after being interrogated, Jim is not at his desk in the background. I think John Krasinski got out of some background work. So now Dwight is we have some footage of Dwight re-creating, the crime scene in the parking lot. He's pretending to smoke the joint. Throw it on the ground. Where would it land if he threw it on the ground? You know what he needs? Some tiny orange cones. Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:25:38] Now, when I watch that, I was like, at what point did Dwight not consider the warehouse or anyone else in the building?

JENNA FISCHER [00:25:47] No, he only interrogates Dunder Mifflin employees.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:25:51] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:25:51] Is that because it was by a Dunder Mifflin employee's car? Maybe.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:25:56] This is like a shared parking lot.

JENNA FISCHER [00:25:58] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:25:58] So I was like, Dwight. I'm questioning your investigation.

JENNA FISCHER [00:26:02] We also had visitors come to the office park.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:26:06] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:26:06] Right? I don't know. Interesting. So then just amazing. Dwight interviews Phyllis.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:26:14] I want more Dwight Phyllis scenes.

JENNA FISCHER [00:26:17] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:26:17] I wish there were more because I love her reaction.

JENNA FISCHER [00:26:20] She is so funny in this.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:26:21] She is so funny.

JENNA FISCHER [00:26:22] Phyllis, you're so funny in this. Dwight shows her a picture of some marijuana and he says, "Do you know what this is"? And she says, "Tt's marijuana"". And he says, How do you know that"? And she says, "Because it's labeled".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:26:37] Yeah, because it's labeled. And he's so ticked off. Well, he's, he's furious, right? That it's labeled marijuana. So there's a deleted scene, you guys, that then Phyllis leaves the office and she has some attitude toward Stanley. And she's like, "He just asked you what marijuana is". And, and then he's like, "Hmmph". And she's like, "You're welcome". Like, she just gave him intel.

JENNA FISCHER [00:27:00] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:27:00] But then my favorite deleted scene of all of them, if you have to watch one is Dwight comes out goes "Stanley, you're next". And Stanley just takes a sip of his coffee and doesn't even look at Dwight. And he's like "Stanley" and he just drinks his coffee. He doesn't get up. He doesn't say a word. And then and then he's like, "OK, fine. Creed", like Stanley is just not having it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:27:26] Stanley is not budging.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:27:27] Yeah. Just drinks his coffee. Doesn't even look at him.

JENNA FISCHER [00:27:30] Doesn't care.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:27:31] Oh my god, it was brilliant. Zero Fs as the kids say.

JENNA FISCHER [00:27:35] Well then Dwight does interview Creed and he shows them the same photo. He's cut off the label.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:27:40] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:27:41] And Creed says, "That is northern lights, cannabis indica" and Dwight's like, "No, damn it, it's marijuana". I looked it up. That is a real strain of marijuana.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:27:54] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:27:54] By the way, it you should know how infrequently I type the word marijuana by the number of times I misspelled it in my document. Really don't know how to spell it.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:07] It's OK. You're gonna be OK.

JENNA FISCHER [00:28:09] I'll be OK.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:10] The DVD commentary did say that someone in the writer's room no names mentioned is who contributed the north-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:28:16] The details.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:17] The details, the fancy name for it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:28:21] So then Dwight interviews Jim, who suggests that it's actually Dwight. It's Dwight's joint, but he just forgot due to his own marijuana use.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:31] This is like a Jim thing that he does that I love when he turns it back on someone and he's done it to Michael and he totally does it to Dwight. And Dwight gets so flustered. I loved it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:28:40] So next, we're in the kitchen and Oscar asked to see Jim's Stanley impression and Stanley catches him.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:28:47] Oh, and Oscar hauls but. He's like, "I'm out". He's like, "I am not gonna get mixed up in this".

JENNA FISCHER [00:28:54] He leaves so quickly. He totally leaves us there. And then Stanley leaves. And Pam and Jim are like, "I do not think that is funny".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:04] At the same time.

JENNA FISCHER [00:29:06] And so Pam jinxes Jim.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:08] And this starts the whole jinx.

JENNA FISCHER [00:29:10] Now, Jim can't talk. He has to buy her Coke. They just run into the break room.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:15] You skip.

JENNA FISCHER [00:29:16] Pam skips into the break room.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:18] Last day of school, skip.

JENNA FISCHER [00:29:20] But guess what? The Coke is sold out.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:23] Did you see what was over your shoulder in the other vending machine?

JENNA FISCHER [00:29:27] Lady, you know, I made a list.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:30] Of the apples and the "Cup of Noodles".

JENNA FISCHER [00:29:33] Yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:33] Well, I'll tell you. My daughter's soccer team made the playoffs. It was very exciting. And we went to this new soccer field and there was a concession stand and they had "Cup of Noodles".

JENNA FISCHER [00:29:45] Uh huh.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:29:46] And my daughter was like, "What is that"? I was like, "Oh, honey, you just add hot water and there's noodles". She was like, "What"? She was like, "That's amazing"! And then all the girls on the soccer team wanted "Cup of Noodles". So, and they loved it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:30:02] They love "Cup of Noodles".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:30:02] She was like, "Mom, this is so smart".

JENNA FISCHER [00:30:07] Well, the thing that's crazy to me is that they have "Nup of noodles" in there. But then they also have something called "Pot O Soup".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:30:14] I don't know "Pot O Soup". What's happening?

JENNA FISCHER [00:30:16] I don't think it's real. I looked it up. And I think that's a fake soup label that Phil Shea made. I'm pretty convinced. But also something you should know, the apples and oranges that are all on the top shelf. Those are all plastic.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:30:29] Oh, yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:30:29] Those aren't real.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:30:30] If you look at them real close, they're shiny.

JENNA FISCHER [00:30:33] Yeah. They lived there for years.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:30:35] Yeah. Oh, guys, it's 7 minutes, 8 seconds. Dwight is now going to interrogate Angela.

JENNA FISCHER [00:30:41] Mmhmm.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:30:41] He says, "Look, I know you're innocent, but I have to make it look real". And then he yells at her and she gives him.

JENNA FISCHER [00:30:49] Again.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:30:50] This like weird "Oh, yeah, baby" smile like "yes".

JENNA FISCHER [00:30:56] Angela likes displays of authority.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:30:59] I think she's all about that uniform. I think she's like, "Yeah, baby".

JENNA FISCHER [00:31:02] A man in uniform.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:03] Put on those tall black boots and stomp around.

JENNA FISCHER [00:31:07] So next up, it's around 7 minutes, 18 seconds, Michael comes into the bullpen and Dwight announces that drug testers are coming to test everyone's urine. Fun fact. We say the word urine 16 times in this episode.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:23] Yeah. Yeah.


JENNA FISCHER [00:31:24] So anyone thinking about, I don't know, doing a drinking game for the word "urine", you don't wanna.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:29] You bring this up in the DVD commentary and everyone turns on you. You're like, "So if you drink every time someone said 'urine', would you get drunk"? And they're like, "Jenna"!

JENNA FISCHER [00:31:38] I did? That's so funny. I am obse-? I clearly I guess I'm slightly obsessed with the fact that we say urine so much.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:45] Yeah, but don't-. Come on, guys, be responsible.

JENNA FISCHER [00:31:47] I did not listen to the commentary. So I.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:50] Isn't that funny? You tell-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:31:51] Fifteen years later, I'm still hung up on this.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:54] Fifteen years later, you tell the same story.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:31:57] I did think it was cute right before this whole like official urine test thing that Kevin genuinely loves Michael's narc bit.

JENNA FISCHER [00:32:05] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:06] He's, he's so there. Like, "Yeah, narc bit".

JENNA FISCHER [00:32:09] Yeah. Michael's trying to relive the glory days of his earlier moment where he kind of got people to laugh at him.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:15] Yeah. Well now he's freaking out because now this urine test is official.

JENNA FISCHER [00:32:20] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:20] And he's like Toby even backs it up. Right?

JENNA FISCHER [00:32:24] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:24] And Michael is sweating. He's got a talking head.

JENNA FISCHER [00:32:28] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:29] He went to an Alicia Keys concert. He scored some great seats at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center.

JENNA FISCHER [00:32:34] Some great aisle seats.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:36] Great aisle seats. I looked up the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center.

JENNA FISCHER [00:32:39] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:39] It's a really cool outdoor venue.

JENNA FISCHER [00:32:41] Oh.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:41] So it's like we're going see concerts outside and it's got kind of this like, like, like permanent sort of tent structure.

JENNA FISCHER [00:32:48] OK.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:49] So it'd probably be a really cool place to see a concert, but a beautiful girl with a lip ring.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:54] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:32:54] Sat next to him. She had what he thought were clove cigarettes. Everyone was doing it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:32:59] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:00] And he's freaked out.

JENNA FISCHER [00:33:02] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:03] And now he's worried. He's worried he's gonna fail the drug test.

JENNA FISCHER [00:33:07] Yes. Cause he's like maybe they weren't clove cigarettes. Maybe they were something else.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:11] I don't know.

JENNA FISCHER [00:33:11] He doesn't know.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:12] My guess is.

JENNA FISCHER [00:33:13] What this lip ringed woman gave him.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:14] This beautiful woman with a lip ring. Probably wasn't smoking a cigarette is my guess. And this starts a whole spiral for Michael.

JENNA FISCHER [00:33:23] Yeah. During all of this, while this is happening, we had a fan catch.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:27] What?

JENNA FISCHER [00:33:27] At 8 minutes, 47 seconds. Olivia Rettig wrote in to say, "I noticed that Jim has a yellow Brunetti's his mug on his desk, which is the restaurant where Ryan picked up pizza in "Take Your Daughter to Work Day".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:42] Oh, good catch.

JENNA FISCHER [00:33:44] Yes, the home of the rectangle pizza and sometimes a circle pizza.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:48] I love that.

JENNA FISCHER [00:33:49] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:50] I have to point out, at 8 minutes, 40 seconds, Dwight has a huge moment for him.

JENNA FISCHER [00:33:54] What is it?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:33:55] I'm sure it sent Angel into a tizzy. He actually can overrule Michael. Michael wants to cancel the drug testing and Dwight says you can't. It's company policy.

JENNA FISCHER [00:34:07] Ooh. Overruled.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:34:08] Yes. Overruled his boss.

JENNA FISCHER [00:34:10] This is when Dwight goes over to accounting. He asks everyone what prescription drugs they're taking. He asks Kevin about his Rogaine.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:34:19] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:34:20] Kevin's like, "I don't use Rogaine".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:34:22] Inappropriate, though, for him to ask.

JENNA FISCHER [00:34:23] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:34:23] Inappropriate.

JENNA FISCHER [00:34:24] Yeah. We're kind of back to remember during health care episode when he was asking us all of our ailments.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:34:29] Personal things.

JENNA FISCHER [00:34:30] Yeah. Then he asked Angela.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:34:33] Mmhmm.

JENNA FISCHER [00:34:33] She says, "I don't take any prescription drugs".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:34:36] And he's like, "What"?

JENNA FISCHER [00:34:38] He's like, "None"?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:34:40] And then I'm like, "Ugh".

JENNA FISCHER [00:34:42] So explain this moment to me, Angela. The look on his face. I feel like obviously he's wondering about birth control.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:34:51] Of course he is.

JENNA FISCHER [00:34:52] Does Angela take birth control? Is Angela saying "No, I don't take birth control". And he's getting this information for the first time. But then he's a little pleased, like, "oh"?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:00] No, not at all.

JENNA FISCHER [00:35:02] What is happening?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:02] Not at all. This is the way I took that scene. Are you taking any prescription drugs? No, I'm not. And then he's like, does the math in his head, like, oh, well, we don't use protection because I assumed she was on the pill. Uh oh, wait, what's happening? Is she not on the pill? And then he looks at her like you don't take anything. And then I'm like, "Of course, I take the pill. But do you think I'm going to tell Kevin? I take the pill". I am not going to admit to Kevin and Oscar that I'm on birth control.

JENNA FISCHER [00:35:33] OK. That was my question was, she, at the end there, they have that little thing.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:41] Yeah, she looks at him like, of course, I'm on the pill and I'm not gonna talk about it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:35:45] And he's relieved.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:47] He's relieved.

JENNA FISCHER [00:35:47] OK.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:47] And she's you know, Angela is never, ever going to discuss her business.

JENNA FISCHER [00:35:52] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:52] In front of Kevin and Oscar.

JENNA FISCHER [00:35:54] Hey. For real. Thanks for explaining that moment to me. I found it confusing.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:35:58] You're welcome.

JENNA FISCHER [00:35:59] I wasn't sure.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:00] Maybe we should have done a better job acting.

JENNA FISCHER [00:36:02] No, it wasn't. I just wasn't 100 percent sure. I didn't know if the little smile there was him being like, "Oh", like, maybe I could be a father or I just didn't, I wasn't totally sure.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:15] I think he's just relieved. He's like, oh, right, right. We are on the same page. OK, good.

JENNA FISCHER [00:36:19] All right. Well, there you go.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:36:21] So 9 minutes, 14 seconds. Poor Jim now is in the break room with Kelly. He's trapped. She is just being a chatty Patty. He can't talk. And this is the second time this has happened for him. So she's going on and on. You guys, if you listen to it, to me, Mindy, Mindy, it just sounds like you talking about an outfit. There is no distinction for me between Mindy and Kelly in this moment. She's like, "I mean, Jim, it's a low cut top that shows a little bit, but not everything, because I'm not like that kind of person". Like, she's like blah blah blah. And then Pam comes in and says, "Hey, guys, Michael wants to see us in the conference room. What's up"? And Kelly's like, oh, we're having a great talk. And she is just messing with Jim. She's like, "Oh, you guys should finish this conversation".

JENNA FISCHER [00:37:04] Oh yeah. You have a few minutes before we need you. Take your time.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:08] Jim's like "buh". I took a screen grab of his face.

JENNA FISCHER [00:37:12] Oh.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:12] As he looks at you, I want you. I will. Can I? Can I post this on "Office Ladies"?

JENNA FISCHER [00:37:16] I don't know.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:17] This made me laugh so hard. OK. This is Jim's face. When you're like, "Oh, no, no, go ahead, finish it. It's totally fine".

JENNA FISCHER [00:37:24] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:25] Ready? This is Jim's face.

JENNA FISCHER [00:37:27] OK.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:30] He is in pain and he's like, "Do not leave, Pam".

JENNA FISCHER [00:37:32] That needs to be a meme.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:36] I know.

JENNA FISCHER [00:37:37] That needs to be a meme like-.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:39] So I put it in-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:37:40] Panic, shock.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:42] I put it-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:37:42] Amazing.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:37:42] I put it my Insta story. And so many people were like, "I know the exact moment. I know the exact moment".

JENNA FISCHER [00:37:49] All right. So now we do go into the conference room for the meeting. It's 9 minutes, 50 seconds. Angela, we had people write in and point out that the conference table is in the conference room.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:02] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:38:03] We are not in our standard rows of chairs. This is the first time I think this has happened since "Performance Review", when we went over the suggestion box.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:14] With Larry Wilmore.

JENNA FISCHER [00:38:15] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:15] Yes.

JENNA FISCHER [00:38:16] Just a little interesting little thing. Every once in a while we have these meetings.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:20] The magical conference table. Where has it been?

JENNA FISCHER [00:38:23] I guess they didn't feel like moving at this time.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:25] Who sets it up?

JENNA FISCHER [00:38:26] We don't know.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:27] Where does it go?

JENNA FISCHER [00:38:29] All right. So now 10 minutes, 21 seconds. Michael has a talking head about being anti-drug. He says he's so anti-drug. He's above susp-. Oh.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:39] Oh my God, that scared me.

JENNA FISCHER [00:38:43] Do you know what that is?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:44] Wait. Oh, I think I do.

JENNA FISCHER [00:38:46] Yay!

ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:46] Oh, my gosh.

JENNA FISCHER [00:38:47] You guys. That means it's time for the "State Farm Real Deal" moment.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:51] Ok.

JENNA FISCHER [00:38:52] That's right. It happens during Michael's talking head about being anti-drug.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:38:57] All right. So we have a lot of questions from fans about specific things that happened on the office. Jenna, you love going through fan questions.

JENNA FISCHER [00:39:03] I do.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:03] You get excited about it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:39:04] I do.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:05] And the questions are like, "Hey, did you guys improvise that line or was that scripted"?

JENNA FISCHER [00:39:09] Or like in the one episode, a lot of people wanted to know if Steve really went to New York.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:14] Right.

JENNA FISCHER [00:39:14] Yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:14] Right.

JENNA FISCHER [00:39:15] And we always try our best to give you the real deal.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:18] Just like our friends at State Farm. If you want to know how much you can save on your auto insurance by bundling with your home policy. They'll always give you the answers you need, when you need them.

JENNA FISCHER [00:39:28] We decided to give you the real deal behind your favorite episodes of "The Office". You guys submitted questions to our website. And today's question is coming from Kierra.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:42] Kierra.

JENNA FISCHER [00:39:43] All right. We actually reached out to Kierra and we asked her to send in a voice memo of her question. So here it is. She's gonna read it herself.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:50] Kierra, you did a great job.

JENNA FISCHER [00:39:52] She did a really good job.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:39:53] I thought you did a great job. Here it is.

KIERA [00:39:54] Hi, Office Ladies. My name is Kierra. My question is, why does Steve have a Band-Aid on his left ring finger in this episode? It looks like maybe it's covering his wedding ring. Is that what's happening? Thank you so much for picking my question. I love your show so much.

JENNA FISCHER [00:40:10] Thank you, Kierra.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:40:12] Oh my gosh, you just sound like we would hang out with you.

JENNA FISCHER [00:40:14] I think you'd be our friend.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:40:16] You sound like our firend.

JENNA FISCHER [00:40:16] Yes. All right. So as soon as I read Kierra's question, I immediately flashed back.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:40:22] Did you remember?

JENNA FISCHER [00:40:23] I 100% remembered. So here is what happened, Kierra. I have a very clear memory of Steve coming in to the hair and makeup trailer. The morning he shot on this episode and his finger, his ring finger where he wears his wedding ring was all swelled up.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:40:40] He had jammed it, right?

JENNA FISCHER [00:40:42] He jammed it.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:40:42] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:40:42] And it wasn't broken. He had gone and had it looked at. Doctor said it's not broken, but there's no way we can get your wedding ring off.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:40:52] So here's the thing. Steve's married in real life. He comes to work. He normally, you have like a little caddy that holds your jewelry. You take off your wedding rings, you get in your costume, your wardrobe for the day.

JENNA FISCHER [00:41:02] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:41:02] And you're someone else in those scenes, right?

JENNA FISCHER [00:41:04] Yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:41:04] You can't have on your wedding ring, Steve. Michael Scott can't have a wedding ring on. He's not married yet.

JENNA FISCHER [00:41:09] Yes. So I remember there was this whole discussion. What are we gonna do? Now remember, Steve only had to work one day this week. There was no way they were gonna make him cut off his wedding band.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:41:21] Right.

JENNA FISCHER [00:41:22] To shoot for one day.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:41:24] Right.

JENNA FISCHER [00:41:24] So instead they came in and they wrapped his wedding ring with this sort of like, I don't know.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:41:31] It was like a Band-Aid kind of looking thing.

JENNA FISCHER [00:41:33] Kind of like a medical tape kind of thing. And if you watch this episode, if you go through, a lot of the time, he keeps his left hand down. Now that you know this fact in rewatching this episode. Look at how often he's hiding his left hand.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:41:51] He's got it in his pocket a few times.

JENNA FISCHER [00:41:53] Yep.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:41:53] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:41:54] Except in this talking head, he brings his hands right up in front of him. He folds his hand and there, it's right there.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:42:02] It's right there.

JENNA FISCHER [00:42:02] Totally see it. That's why Kierra saw. I did go through and I did clock the other times I could see it. I could only see it three other times.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:42:13] I just remember it in the talking head. Where else did you see the Band-Aid thing?

JENNA FISCHER [00:42:16] I saw it at 4 minutes, 11 seconds, 7 minutes, 21 seconds and 14 minutes, 46 seconds. But I'm telling you guys, that's because I saw a flash of his left hand and I paused. So I want you guys to know that I traded messages with Steve Carell. I wanted to confirm that my memory was true. And he said, "Yes, this is all true". This is, my memory was correct. But he gave me an added detail.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:42:44] How did he jam his finger? Did he tell you?

JENNA FISCHER [00:42:46] Yes! He told me he jammed it playing pickup hockey. Remember? In "Michael's Birthday", we told you guys that Steve was a hockey player.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:42:54] He's very good.

JENNA FISCHER [00:42:54] Yeah. And he would play pickup hockey. And so he jammed it playing pickup hockey.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:42:59] Well, there you have it, folks. When you want the real deal on "The Office", we're your ladies.

JENNA FISCHER [00:43:04] When you want the real deal on insurance like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:08] And Kierra, since we picked your question to be the "State Farm Real Deal Moment", you are gonna get a swag bag with some "Office Ladies" merch from us.

JENNA FISCHER [00:43:16] Including a signed "Office Ladies mug".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:18] Yes. And if you guys out there want to submit your questions about a future episode, just go to OfficeLadies.com/realdeal

JENNA FISCHER [00:43:27] Yep. We're gonna be doing this for a little while, so get your questions in.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:30] Yay.

JENNA FISCHER [00:43:30] All right. So now we are back in the conference room and Michael starts rattling off drug statistics.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:37] He does. And I have to just point out one thing about this conference room.

JENNA FISCHER [00:43:41] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:41] There is a lot of Angela sass. I don't know if it's because I'm sit, like seated like right front and center there. There are so many Angela Martin eyerolls.

JENNA FISCHER [00:43:52] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:52] In this episode.

JENNA FISCHER [00:43:53] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:54] In the conference room.

JENNA FISCHER [00:43:55] This is a gif maker's dream.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:43:56] Yeah. This scene is a ton of Angela sass.

JENNA FISCHER [00:44:00] One of Michael's statistics is he says that more people will use cocaine than read a book to their children this year.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:07] Yeah. Jen Celotta in the DVD commentary said that that got her so tickled that they wanted to make it sort of the bar that Michael measures everything from. That he would just keep saying, like, whatever it was happening in the world, then more people will read a book to their children.

JENNA FISCHER [00:44:22] I love-. That line to me was just perfection in writing. I loved that. Then Michael reveals his list of illegal drugs.


ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:32] So Michael says he's ridiculously anti-drug. Right? And he then goes on to say that. I mean, that Cheech and Chong would have been funnier. Right?

JENNA FISCHER [00:44:45] Wouldn't they? Imagine how funny they could be if they weren't stoned?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:49] And it cuts to my face and I make it like a "what"? Like a weird eyeroll, like, "What the heck"? This is actually a reaction from a different moment.

JENNA FISCHER [00:44:58] Really?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:44:58] Yes. In a deleted scene, Michael is going off and he's trying to say the word "omniscient", but he can't say it. And I like make a big eyeroll and look at him like, you idiot. And that's the reaction. They took it and then put it to Cheech and Chong, because when I watch this, I was like, why, would Angela Martin even know Cheech and Chong.

JENNA FISCHER [00:45:18] I had that same thought.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:45:19] Why is she reacting like, "Oh, please, Michael, it's Cheech and Chong. Come on, everyone knows their act".

JENNA FISCHER [00:45:25] It was so funny, though.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:45:26] It was really funny. But it's to a different moment, which makes sense to me because I don't think Angela Martin would have reacted like that.

JENNA FISCHER [00:45:33] To that line.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:45:34] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:45:34] I agree. So now Michael reveals his list of illegal drugs. He wants us to know these drugs are illegal. Did you write him down?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:45:43] I did. He wrote crack, cocaine, pot, blow, acid, hookah, heroin, spelled like the heroine, the female heroine.

JENNA FISCHER [00:45:52] Right.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:45:52] The heroine of a story.

JENNA FISCHER [00:45:54] Right.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:45:55] And speed.

JENNA FISCHER [00:45:56] And speed. So aren't crack, cocaine and blow all kind of like variations on the same drug? I mean, I'm not a drug expert, but Sam's nodding. So he.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:46:07] Oh, Sam. Poor Sam, Poor Sam.

JENNA FISCHER [00:46:09] We're always like, "Sam tell us about corn hole and drugs".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:46:14] Whenever we have any questions about inappropriate behavior, we turn to Sam.

JENNA FISCHER [00:46:20] Toby says hookah is not an illegal drug. And Michael says, I'm going to test your hair and blood randomly.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:46:26] I mean, wait. This is great, too. So and then he's like, "Pam, can you write this down"?

JENNA FISCHER [00:46:32] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:46:32] And Pam's like "I got I got nothing".

JENNA FISCHER [00:46:33] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:46:34] OK. So here is something so great. Somewhere right in here, there is a deleted scene where all of a sudden out of nowhere you hear Jan's voice and she's like, "Michael, I don't think I need to be on the line for this".

JENNA FISCHER [00:46:48] Oh.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:46:51] And then Pam goes, "Has Jan on the phone the whole time"?

JENNA FISCHER [00:46:54] Is that maybe why the conference table is there, because he had Jan on speaker phone?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:03] The phone is by you.

JENNA FISCHER [00:47:05] Oh my god.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:05] Next to you. It's not even on the conference table. And yes. Jan hangs up and you're like, "Was she was a phone the whole time"? Isn't that crazy? It made me laugh so hard.

JENNA FISCHER [00:47:19] I totally oh, I wish we'd kept that in.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:22] I know.

JENNA FISCHER [00:47:23] Why did that get deleted?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:23] We probably had to cut it for time, but it was really funny.

JENNA FISCHER [00:47:26] Oh, that's too bad. Well, that whole "Pam, can you take this down moment"? That was improvised.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:31] I loved it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:47:31] I was like, "I don't have anything to write it down with".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:36] And they kept it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:47:37] They kept it in.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:38] I have a thing for my journal entry about the scene.

JENNA FISCHER [00:47:41] Ok.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:42] I said, that we really were laughing so much in this scene and in between takes Creed would tell us stories from his time that he was in a band, "The Grassroots", and they traveled with "The Doors". So there was-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:47:55] Oh yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:47:56] There was some drug use, guys, and Creed would tell us stories. Creed, of course, is hilarious. And I don't even know if half of what he said was true or not. But we were cracking up.

JENNA FISCHER [00:48:08] He had us riveted.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:10] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:48:10] He had us riveted. I have a question about that in all of this drug testing that's going on. Why is Creed not worried? And how does he pass? His character clearly uses recreational drugs.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:25] I would think, my backstory for that would be that Creed found a way to like he has a stash of urine.

JENNA FISCHER [00:48:31] He's got like, he's got a go around.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:33] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:48:33] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:33] He's got a way around it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:48:35] OK, so now Pam raises her hand and says, "Jim has an amazing story about a relative that got, quote, caught up in the world of drugs".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:46] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:48:47] But Jim can't talk.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:49] She's messing with him.

JENNA FISCHER [00:48:50] She's messing with him.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:50] She's messing with him.

JENNA FISCHER [00:48:52] Michael is like, "Jim, stand up. Let's hear your story".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:55] This is your time to share.

JENNA FISCHER [00:48:57] John Krasinski is so good in this scene.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:48:59] He's so good.

JENNA FISCHER [00:49:00] His silent performance.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:02] He's a brilliant actor with like no words. He's great with words without words. He's amazing.

JENNA FISCHER [00:49:07] By the way, I think he made a whole movie based on that. It's called "A Quiet Place" and "A Quiet Place: Part Two".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:13] He's so good, he can do anything with his face.

JENNA FISCHER [00:49:15] He can do non-verbal acting like great.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:17] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:49:18] Mmhmm.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:20] Well, I want you guys to look at 12 minutes, 46 seconds. Jenna, I'm going to show you the picture.

JENNA FISCHER [00:49:24] What happened?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:25] I want you to guess who I'm looking at. With this true concern and worry and compassion. Angela Martin.

JENNA FISCHER [00:49:36] OK.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:36] True concern and compassion. Look at that.

JENNA FISCHER [00:49:40] Are you looking at Jim?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:41] I'm looking at Jim.

JENNA FISCHER [00:49:43] Oh, you're so worried about his family member who got caught up in the world of drugs.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:47] This might be the only time in the whole series that Angela Martin looks at Jim with compassion.

JENNA FISCHER [00:49:54] Wow.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:49:55] People were worried. He teared up. Pam is impressed. She has a talking head now by the front door of the office. They have the Dunder-Mifflin sign right there.

JENNA FISCHER [00:50:04] Yep.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:50:05] This is like no one ever really has talking heads in these places by the kitchen door, by the sign in the front.

JENNA FISCHER [00:50:11] Yeah. Well she can't do it in the conference room because everybody's in there.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:50:14] Right.

JENNA FISCHER [00:50:14] So they had to put her by the sign.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:50:16] So you're by-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:50:17] Well, you know what that is by the way? That's Greg Daniels. Greg Daniels directed this episode and he very often did our talking heads places other than the formal places, especially if he felt like the talking head was a reaction to something that was happening in the moment. He would call them "on the fly" talking heads. I got to get your feelings about this moment on the fly.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:50:39] He loved that.

JENNA FISCHER [00:50:40] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:50:41] I loved it, too. It's kind of a fun way to mix up the talking heads. But Pam is legit impressed with Jim.

JENNA FISCHER [00:50:47] Oh, yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:50:47] She's like, wow. Wow.

JENNA FISCHER [00:50:48] She's super, super like enamored in this talking head. So now back in the conference room, Dwight has to remind Michael that he will also be tested. He's really like ""Michael. I'm sorry, but you're gonna be tested.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:51:04] Michael's like, "Hey, guys. No one hates drugs more than I do in this office".

JENNA FISCHER [00:51:08] Yeah. So I don't need to be tested.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:51:10] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:51:10] Dwight's like, "You're gonna be tested". And Michael's like, "I don't even, I don't even know if anything's going to come out when I pee. I'm very busy today. I don't know if anything is going to come out".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:51:19] "I'm so busy. I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom today".

JENNA FISCHER [00:51:21] Yeah. "I don't have time". All right. So I think we should take a break and we will come back with Linda, the drug tester.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:51:30] Linda.

JENNA FISCHER [00:51:31] Linda is gonna come test everyone for drugs. But you know what? Let's take a break and we'll be back with some formal drug testing.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:51:37] Yeah, because unlike Michael, I actually do plan on going to the bathroom.

JENNA FISCHER [00:51:41] I could use the bathroom break.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:51:42] I have to go pee.

JENNA FISCHER [00:51:43] Yeah, me too.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:51:43] Is that an overshare?

JENNA FISCHER [00:51:44] It's not an overshare. We're not going to test you for drugs while you pee today, Angela.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:51:48] Are you in charge of drug testing, Jenna?

JENNA FISCHER [00:51:50] I could be.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:51:51] Oh, Lord.

JENNA FISCHER [00:51:52] All right. And we're back. Angela peed. Well, I, I did end up testing her urine.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:52:00] Oh, great.

JENNA FISCHER [00:52:00] Urine, urine, urine.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:52:02] I tes-, I passed, guys.

JENNA FISCHER [00:52:04] She passed. She passed. At 14 minutes, Linda, the drug tester, has arrived. She is played by Marilyn Brett. Marilyn Brett has done a whole bunch of like small roles in film and television, including the most recent "Captain Marvel" movie. Here's my question. I did see "Wonder Woman". It's so badass.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:52:30] I loved "Wonder Woman".

JENNA FISCHER [00:52:31] Loved it. How old do my kids have to be to see "Wonder Woman"? I watched it a second time with that in mind, because there is shooting and there is people getting killed. It's not gruesome or graphic, but there is that kind of what is the age for that?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:52:47] There is some sexual innuendo.

JENNA FISCHER [00:52:49] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:52:50] Well, there-.

JENNA FISCHER [00:52:51] Commonsense Media is good for that.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:52:52] Commonsense Media, that's what, we always check.

JENNA FISCHER [00:52:53] Parents all do that. Guys, this is not an ad for Commonsense Media. But it could be. It should be. I'd give one. Here's a free one. Commonsense Media for parents. You can check it out.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:53:02] It's great. It's great. They kind of go through movies and sort of talk about the content.

JENNA FISCHER [00:53:05] Yeah. They give an age recommendation. Yeah, well, there you go. That took a strange turn.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:53:12] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:53:12] We were talking about Linda, the drug tester. Dwight is asking her, "Hey, do you remember me? Nice to see you". And she's like.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:53:21] "I test a lot of people's urine".

JENNA FISCHER [00:53:22] Yeah. Dude, I do this a lot. And he's like, "Yeah, but mine was green".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:53:27] She's like, "Oh, yes. How are you doing"?

JENNA FISCHER [00:53:31] And he's like, "I'm better". Well, we got a lot of mail about that.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:53:35] We did?

JENNA FISCHER [00:53:36] About green urine.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:53:37] Oh.

JENNA FISCHER [00:53:38] Angela, green urine is very rare.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:53:40] Oh, ok.

JENNA FISCHER [00:53:40] I investigated it.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:53:43] I can't wait to hear what you found.

JENNA FISCHER [00:53:45] Well, it's mostly connected to something you ate. But-

ANGELA KINSEY [00:53:49] Asparagus? Maybe.

JENNA FISCHER [00:53:49] Not asparagus.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:53:50] OK.

JENNA FISCHER [00:53:51] Like, let's say you're at a kid's birthday party and they serve an ice cream cake with like super blue icing. Like blue dye icing.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:54:00] OK.

JENNA FISCHER [00:54:00] Turns your mouth blue.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:54:02] And your pee green.

JENNA FISCHER [00:54:03] Correct.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:54:04] OK.

JENNA FISCHER [00:54:05] Now, if you haven't eaten something like that, you might want to call your doctor if you pee green because it could also be caused by a bacterial infection or it is a side effect of some medications.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:54:18] All right, guys. You heard it here from Dr. Jenna.

JENNA FISCHER [00:54:20] That's right. And I had a list of all the medications, but Angela won't let me read it because she said it was too boring.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:54:28] I did not say that. I did not say that. I want you guys to know she read them. And I thought some of it was gruesome.

JENNA FISCHER [00:54:35] And she said-.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:54:36] And off putting as she listed the side effects. And I thought, oh, lord, you know.

JENNA FISCHER [00:54:41] I think it was a good call. She made me redo it. And I think that was a good call, Ang.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:54:46] I just, I just don't want to scare all the children away.

JENNA FISCHER [00:54:49] We do. We do that sometimes on the podcast.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:54:53] She'll say, "Ang".

JENNA FISCHER [00:54:54] Sometimes we think better of something.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:54:55] She'll say, "Ang, you can't say that". You guys, there was just a prescription medicine and the side effects were like, OK. Well, throw in the towel because it's over. I want you to notice, though, in the background while Linda is talking to Dwight. Michael is pacing back and forth. He is freaking out.

JENNA FISCHER [00:55:14] He's really lurking. And also in the background is Luanne. Luanne is back there and she's in the background a lot in this episode. We got a lot of mail about that, actually, wondering who is the woman playing solitaire on her computer in the background? Who is in the background of this scene while Michael is lurking? It's Luanne.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:55:29] Luanne Alert.

JENNA FISCHER [00:55:31] So now. Michael calls Dwight into his office. Oh, my gosh. The scene is so good. It's a spy shot through the window where Michael is telling Dwight, "I need your urine".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:55:44] Yeah. In the DVD commentary, Jen talks about how the tone of the scene, they almost wanted it like a scene like in "The Godfather". Like this, this deed that I'm going to ask you.

JENNA FISCHER [00:55:54] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:55:54] Has a lot-, has a lot of weight to it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:55:57] Yeah. Michael kind of tells Dwight all about the Alicia Keys concert, all about the girl with the lip ring. And Dwight is like, "Oh, whoah".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:56:07] Wow.

JENNA FISCHER [00:56:07] Yeah, I hear you.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:56:09] Wow.

JENNA FISCHER [00:56:10] And then this is my favorite line. Dwight's like "Michael. I don't think I can do it". And Michael says, "Urine goes all over the place. There's no controlling it".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:56:21] Dwight says "Not mine".

JENNA FISCHER [00:56:24] He says, "The cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident".

ANGELA KINSEY [00:56:28] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:56:29] You didn't do it on purpose.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:56:30] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:56:31] The urine just flew into the cup.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:56:33] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [00:56:34] And then you handed it to me. All right. Something I want to talk about in this scene, though.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:56:38] Mmhmm.

JENNA FISCHER [00:56:38] At 14 minutes, 23 seconds, there is a framed photo of the employees of Dunder Mifflin on this little table that's opposite Michael's desk.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:56:51] That was on one of my cards as well. And we know the story behind this photo.

JENNA FISCHER [00:56:56] It is from an episode that we shot. But since these aired out of order.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:57:02] You haven't seen it yet.

JENNA FISCHER [00:57:04] You haven't seen it yet. It's from the "Conflict Resolution" episode.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:57:08] Yes. And Michael photoshops our faces.

JENNA FISCHER [00:57:12] Yes. He's trying to get a group shot, but he can't get it. So he does this sort of clumsy photoshopped one and he frames that and he puts in his office and continuity error. We forgot to take it down for the scene.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:57:25] We all have a copy of this photo in a frame that Greg Daniels gave us as a gift as well. I still have mine.

JENNA FISCHER [00:57:31] Oh, oh, I love that.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:57:33] And now, guys, it's 15 minutes, 45 seconds. And Angela and Dwight are in the kitchen.

JENNA FISCHER [00:57:38] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:57:39] I really think that Michael is a big source of conflict for them in their relationship.

JENNA FISCHER [00:57:45] Yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:57:45] Because constantly, Angela thinks Michael is an idiot and she thinks, why would Dwight support this idiot?

JENNA FISCHER [00:57:53] His loyalty to Michael is a sticking point for her because it causes Dwight to go against his principles.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:58:00] His moral compass.

JENNA FISCHER [00:58:01] And if there is nothing that Angela loves more than a good principle.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:58:05] I know, except when she needs to bend it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:58:08] Well yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:58:08] To serve her purpose.

JENNA FISCHER [00:58:09] That's right.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:58:10] But yes, she definitely thinks that Michael is Dwight soft spot, and it makes him lose his judgment. So she just says to him in the kitchen, she's like, "Listen, I can't, I cannot, you know, approve of this. I'm not gonna give you my approval". And he's he's like, "Angela, I want him to have all the urine he needs". All of it.

JENNA FISCHER [00:58:34] All the urine he needs. Lady, your hair is so long and pretty in that scene, too.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:58:39] Oh, thank you.

JENNA FISCHER [00:58:40] Did you notice it?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:58:41] I noticed.

JENNA FISCHER [00:58:43] It's gorgeous.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:58:43] Thank you.

JENNA FISCHER [00:58:43] It's like what's happening?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:58:46] I noticed how long it was.

JENNA FISCHER [00:58:47] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:58:47] It's super long. It's probably the longest I've ever had my hair.

JENNA FISCHER [00:58:51] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:58:51] I don't know.

JENNA FISCHER [00:58:53] It was very flowing.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:58:54] Oh.

JENNA FISCHER [00:58:54] In that scene.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:58:56] Well thank you.

JENNA FISCHER [00:58:56] I noticed.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:58:57] Thanks.

JENNA FISCHER [00:58:58] All right. So now we have Dwight's talking head. And this is the talking head that Greg Daniels talked about in "Booze Cruise" with us.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:59:09] Yes.

JENNA FISCHER [00:59:09] Where he talks about his ancestors. And he says his, was it his great grandfather was Dwight Schrute Amish?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:59:16] Yes. So there's a great little tidbit in the DVD commentary about this. So if you get the CDs, this is a great one.

JENNA FISCHER [00:59:23] I love that you just called them CDs, Angela.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:59:26] Are they? What are they?

JENNA FISCHER [00:59:27] DVDs, right?

ANGELA KINSEY [00:59:29] When you get your VHS.

JENNA FISCHER [00:59:30] No, it's so cute because CDs are what we used to listen to music on.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:59:34] I'll never get it right. My kids have given up on correcting me.

JENNA FISCHER [00:59:37] It's such a mom moment.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:59:38] I know. And my kids used to correct me. And now they're like, yeah, yeah, fine. OK. These CDs.

JENNA FISCHER [00:59:44] These are the things that we do that annoy our children that I know our parents had like.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:59:47] I know.

JENNA FISCHER [00:59:48] Things they did to us. But that was such a mom moment.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:59:51] OK. I know. OK.

JENNA FISCHER [00:59:53] I love it.

ANGELA KINSEY [00:59:53] In the DVDs, so this talking head where Rnain improvised that his father was Dwight Schrute. His grandfather's Dwight Schrute. His father was Dwight Shrewd Amish, was a whole talking head that Rainn improvised in the pilot. It was in the pilot, but they they didn't have time for it. And Greg loved it so much. He was like, I'm gonna find a way to get that back in. So Rainn did it in this episode.

JENNA FISCHER [01:00:19] 26 episodes later.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:00:21] Yes.

JENNA FISCHER [01:00:22] Wow.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:00:22] I know.

JENNA FISCHER [01:00:23] That shows you Greg Daniels, right? Like Greg Daniels is like, I will not forget.


ANGELA KINSEY [01:00:29] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [01:00:29] I have spotted a moment of genius. And by God, it will find its way into the series.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:00:35] Yes. And so he made it happen. He found the moment. And then, of course, this whole talking head really just opens up a whole world. That is Moze, the beet Farm, their Amish background.

JENNA FISCHER [01:00:48] All of that. So, guys, Dwight does give Michael his urine.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:00:54] Oh, he does.

JENNA FISCHER [01:00:55] In a to-go coffee cup labeled "Michael Scott sample".

ANGELA KINSEY [01:00:59] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [01:00:59] He does it. You see him sort of walking around the office with it, but he does actually do it.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:01:04] Oh, he's debating it. He's going back and forth. This is a tough decision. And Jim's watching this. He's like, what is happening? And Dwight has this talking head about how his dad used to cheat when they played games. And he didn't know it at the time, of course. But years later, his dad told him and he was shocked.

JENNA FISCHER [01:01:22] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:01:24] He was, I mean, Dwight's is so childlike, you know? But it's interesting that that talking head is what's happening while he is debating on helping someone who is like a father figure to him.

JENNA FISCHER [01:01:34] Well, after he does this, he decides I can't be a volunteer sheriff anymore.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:01:40] I have to turn in my uniform.

JENNA FISCHER [01:01:42] And he does.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:01:43] And there is a deleted scene.

JENNA FISCHER [01:01:45] Of him going into the sheriff's office.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:01:47] Yes. And it's really good.

JENNA FISCHER [01:01:49] Yeah, it is really good. And he gives back his badge and the guy's like, "We never gave you that".

ANGELA KINSEY [01:01:55] Where did you get this?

JENNA FISCHER [01:01:55] He's like, "The gift shop".

ANGELA KINSEY [01:01:57] And then he's like, "Did you ever dress in uniform"? He goes, "Oh, yeah, I did a lot". And he goes, he hits a record button. He goes, "You're gonna need to tell me everything you did in this uniform".

JENNA FISCHER [01:02:07] Well, I went to Kent-apedia.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:02:09] Oh, Kent-apedia.

JENNA FISCHER [01:02:11] Because we had a fan question from Heather Buckley, "What building was used as the sheriff's station where Dwight returns his uniform"? We did not fly to Scranton and shoot the exterior of the Scranton police station. It was actually the Van Nuys courthouse in Van Nuys, California. But the multiple scenes that are shot inside, Kent told me they built those on Stage Two, behind the warehouse. So while all this is happening, Jim and Pam are in the kitchen.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:02:43] It's flirty, mcflirty time.

JENNA FISCHER [01:02:45] It is. Well, it starts flirty and then it ends real sad.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:02:49] And then it destroys you.

JENNA FISCHER [01:02:51] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:02:52] This scene at 17 minutes, 6 seconds. They're flirting, you know. And then at 17:25.

JENNA FISCHER [01:02:58] Well, you look like you want to tell me something, Jim. You can tell me anything. Come on.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:03:04] Loaded question.

JENNA FISCHER [01:03:07] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:03:07] 'Cause his heart is on his sleeve right now.

JENNA FISCHER [01:03:09] Yeah. Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:03:11] Oh, my gosh, John Krasinski, your face, and then Jenna, your face, at the realization. Brilliant. Amazing. You guys just crushed it in the scene. So I know this is sort of jogging back in time a little bit, but I loved when Ryan asked Linda if they were hiring. And she was like, "You want to work at a urine analysis lab"? He was like, "Maybe". And then Kevin. I thought there was a little bit of foreshadowing here.

JENNA FISCHER [01:03:38] OK.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:03:39] At 17 minutes, 57 seconds. It's Kevin's turn to give his urine sample. And he asked Linda for a magazine.

JENNA FISCHER [01:03:46] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:03:46] And Linda's like, "It's just a urine sample". And he's like, "Well, still". But listen. Is this a little foreshadowing? Kevin is used to when he has to give a little something of himself. He has to have a magazine because he goes to a sperm bank all the time.

JENNA FISCHER [01:04:03] He does?

ANGELA KINSEY [01:04:04] Season five. There's a great scene in the "Baby Shower" episode where Jan is saying she used a sperm bank.

JENNA FISCHER [01:04:11] Oh, that's right.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:04:12] Kevin's like, "Which one"? And she's like, "You wouldn't know it. It's very prestigious". And he goes, she goes, "It's in-". And he goes. "Is it oh, is it by that 7-Eleven"? I forget what he says.

JENNA FISCHER [01:04:20] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:04:21] The look over her face of like, "Oh, crap, that's the one". And Kevin goes on to say that he donates to a sperm bank quite a bit. So I thought it was pretty funny.

JENNA FISCHER [01:04:32] Yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:04:32] I thought it was pretty funny that he asked Linda for a magazine.

JENNA FISCHER [01:04:34] It's just that, he's used to that.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:04:36] He's used to going somewhere, getting a cup and a magazine and going in a room.

JENNA FISCHER [01:04:43] Oh, that's such a good catch, Ang. I love that. So now Michael tells Dwight he passed the test.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:04:53] Yes.

JENNA FISCHER [01:04:54] And Dwight is like, "That's great. I turned in my uniform".

ANGELA KINSEY [01:04:58] Yeah. And Michael can really tell how upset Dwight is. And there is a spy shot, not a peep shot. See, Jenna. I'm learning.

JENNA FISCHER [01:05:05] Ok. Peep shot.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:05:06] There's a spy shot through the blinds of Michael pacing. He's-.

JENNA FISCHER [01:05:10] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:05:10] He knows that he's hurt his friend.

JENNA FISCHER [01:05:12] This is weighing on him. In the meantime, Pam comes in. She's got her coat on. She's been out. Where was she? Guys, she bought a Coke.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:05:24] Yes.

JENNA FISCHER [01:05:24] And she gives it to Jim and says, "Will you just buy this coke off me? Because I really miss you and I want to talk to you". And so he gives her a dollar. He hands her the coke. And now the jinx is broken.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:05:36] The jinx is broken. I have my MySpace blog from back then and a question people asked a lot. I looked at it and they were like, I, and I wrote in my MySpace blog, a lot of you asked about the Coke scootch.

JENNA FISCHER [01:05:50]  The three little taps on the coke.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:05:52] Tap, tap, tap. Yeah. And they wanted to know if it was scripted. They said no. Jenna just did that.

JENNA FISCHER [01:05:56] That was improvised. And after I did it, I'll never forget Greg Daniels goes, "Oh, I love that. Oh, I love the little taps on the soda".

ANGELA KINSEY [01:06:05] Yeah. And-.

JENNA FISCHER [01:06:06] He was like, we're using that one. We're using that one. We're in the middle of filming. And he was like, when you edit this, you got to use the three taps. I only did it that one time, but he was so delighted in the moment.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:06:16] It's very cute. And then also you guys saying hi and hey to each other was not scripted.

JENNA FISCHER [01:06:22] That's right. Yeah, that was not scripted.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:06:26] No. That was just in the moment. It was really sweet. So they have this whole scene where he gets sworn in by Hank, the security guard.

JENNA FISCHER [01:06:32] Yes. He gets sworn in as honorary volunteer corporal.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:06:36] Corporal. As part of the official security supervisor.

JENNA FISCHER [01:06:40] Yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:06:40] Branch.

JENNA FISCHER [01:06:41] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:06:42] Is this a little foreshadowing to the "Fire Drill" episode in season 5, Jenna?

JENNA FISCHER [01:06:47] What happens in that one?

ANGELA KINSEY [01:06:48] Dwight decides one of our security measures were lacking in is safe fire skills.

JENNA FISCHER [01:06:53] Oh, perhaps. This is now under the umbrella of being this official officer.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:06:58] Why would he think that he could lock us in a room and start a fire unless he didn't feel like he had the power to do it?

JENNA FISCHER [01:07:05] This is where it started.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:07:06] You guys, I'm seeing a lot of like little things tipping to later seasons.

JENNA FISCHER [01:07:10] Well, at 19 minutes and 30 seconds, we had a fan catch. Olivia Fitzgerald and Michael Gabay wrote in to say, "When they're talking to the security guy, his name tag says Tate".

ANGELA KINSEY [01:07:24] No.

JENNA FISCHER [01:07:25] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:07:26] Oh, good catch.

JENNA FISCHER [01:07:27] It's his Tate. So, Angela, I spent about 40 minutes on this nametag.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:07:32] Oh, no.

JENNA FISCHER [01:07:33] Let me tell you.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:07:34] Oh lord.

JENNA FISCHER [01:07:35] So, first of all, the security officer who we know as Hank.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:07:39] Yes.

JENNA FISCHER [01:07:39] Who was played by Hugh Dane.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:07:41] Who was amazing.

JENNA FISCHER [01:07:42] Amazing. We first met him in the "Halloween" episode, which was 15 episodes ago.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:07:48] Right.

JENNA FISCHER [01:07:49] He didn't speak.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:07:50] Right.

JENNA FISCHER [01:07:50] Now 15 episodes later, he shows up. He's got a nametag that says Tate. Now, Hank will not be back again until Season 4.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:08:01] Wow.

JENNA FISCHER [01:08:01] The episode is "Night Out". I'm like, well, I got to watch night out and see what his nametag says.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:08:08] Oh, my lord.

JENNA FISCHER [01:08:09] Guess what?

ANGELA KINSEY [01:08:10] What's it say?

JENNA FISCHER [01:08:11] He doesn't wear a uniform in that one.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:08:13] Oh, fart.

JENNA FISCHER [01:08:14] No name tag. So next episode he's in is  "Goodbye, Toby".

ANGELA KINSEY [01:08:18] So you watch that?

JENNA FISCHER [01:08:20] Guess what?

ANGELA KINSEY [01:08:21] No name tag.

JENNA FISCHER [01:08:21] No name tag. At this point, I stopped watching episodes. OK. I was like, this is gone.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:08:28] Three hours of your life.

JENNA FISCHER [01:08:29] It's gone too far already. By the way, these were all great episodes, especially "Goodbye Toby". Anyway, he is going to come back in Season 5 again. And when we get to that episode, I will look for a name tag. I'm gonna track it. I'll track the name tag. On Dunderpedia, they list his name as Hank Tate.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:08:51] Oh.

JENNA FISCHER [01:08:51] So they assigned Tate as his last name. I'm not sure that's official, but I think that's one way to go with it.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:08:57] That is a one way to go with it. That might save you three hours.

JENNA FISCHER [01:08:59] Yeah. So thank you for that fan catch. I have a Jenna catch.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:09:04] OK.

JENNA FISCHER [01:09:04] From this scene.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:09:05] OK.

JENNA FISCHER [01:09:05] At 20 minutes, 21 seconds, when Dwight asks Hank how many orange traffic cones he has.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:09:11] Yeah.

JENNA FISCHER [01:09:12] You can see our camera operators elbow in the shot.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:09:14] Oh, you can?

JENNA FISCHER [01:09:15] So that's my Jenna catch.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:09:17] Well, poor Hank is now stuck with Dwight. He wants to bring his bow staff to work.

JENNA FISCHER [01:09:21] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:09:22] He wants, he's like judging him for his cone usage. I'll tell you a scene I wish there had been. I really want to see the scene where Michael goes down to Hank and says, "Here's the deal. Dwight's having a rough day. He has to be part of your security team". And Hank's like, "Hell no".

JENNA FISCHER [01:09:43] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:09:44] I want to see that scene.

JENNA FISCHER [01:09:47] Yes. The scene that preceded the scene.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:09:48] Yes.

JENNA FISCHER [01:09:49] Because you can tell that scene happened. Like you can tell that moment happen all by the way that Hugh plays it, because you can tell that he's like gotten roped into a some idea.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:10:00] He's totally annoyed.

JENNA FISCHER [01:10:02] Yeah. All right, guys. Final scene, Jim and Pam are finally talking in the break room and they're sharing the Coke. Just like you and Oscar.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:10:17] Two little cups.

JENNA FISCHER [01:10:19] Yeah, two little cups with a Coke.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:10:20] That would be our treat.

JENNA FISCHER [01:10:21] And Jim has this talking head where he is talking about Michael and Dwight and he's saying about Dwight, "I just don't see what he gets out of that relationship".

ANGELA KINSEY [01:10:30] Yeah, but in the meantime.

JENNA FISCHER [01:10:34] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:10:34] He didn't talk for a whole day because the person he's in love with thought it would be fun.

JENNA FISCHER [01:10:39] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:10:40] What is he getting out of this relationship?

JENNA FISCHER [01:10:41] What is he getting out of this relationship?

ANGELA KINSEY [01:10:43] And that's how it ends.

JENNA FISCHER [01:10:45] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:10:46] Well, listen, that was very loaded, that scene.

JENNA FISCHER [01:10:49] Mmhmm.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:10:50] I felt like. And there are some deleted scenes that we didn't get to talk about. One, I have to bring this one up. Jim gets a call at front reception, Pam answers it. It's Brenda.

JENNA FISCHER [01:11:02] What?

ANGELA KINSEY [01:11:03] Yes.

JENNA FISCHER [01:11:03] So is that obviously who he went on the date with.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:11:06] I would think.

JENNA FISCHER [01:11:07] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:11:08] I would think. And Pam is like, "Oh". And sends the call through and then looks at Jim like, "Are you gonna answer it"? And he doesn't. And then he has this moment.

JENNA FISCHER [01:11:18] Does say it's Brenda?

ANGELA KINSEY [01:11:20] She goes, "Yeah, Jim, call for you. It's Brenda".

JENNA FISCHER [01:11:24] Wow.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:11:25] And then it cuts to him by himself in the hallway, by the Dunder-Mifflin sign. And he holds up a little like piece of paper he's written on and it says "She'll call back".

JENNA FISCHER [01:11:36] Oh.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:11:37] Someone's confident. Also, there's a talking head that I have. It's also in the bloopers and Jen Celotta and I could not get through this. We kept laughing. It's probably one of the reasons why they didn't use it. But I have a line where I say "I used to get a runner's high. That's why now I swim".

JENNA FISCHER [01:11:55] I remember that.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:11:56] And Jen could not stop laughing. So in the bloopers, you hear her cracking up.

JENNA FISCHER [01:11:59] I feel like Jen was particularly tickled by Angela, by the way. I felt like whenever you guys, whenever you had to do a talking head from a Jen Celotta episode, everyone was like, "All right, this is gonna be awhile, 'cause these two girls are just going to crack up.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:12:13] Well, my lines were always so ridiculous. Like the stuff she would write for me would be so-.

JENNA FISCHER [01:12:18] That's what I mean. I think she liked your character.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:12:20] And the same with Dwight. She loved Dwight, too, because there's a deleted scene that's also in the bloopers where Dwight has this talking head saying, "I will find the person who committed this heinous crime if I have to pray to Thor himself".

JENNA FISCHER [01:12:33] Yes.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:12:33] He has this ridiculous talking head. Rainn could not get through it.

JENNA FISCHER [01:12:36] No.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:12:36] Rainn and Jen, they were dying. And then lastly in the deleted scenes.

JENNA FISCHER [01:12:40] Is this when we find out whose joint it was.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:12:43] Yes.

JENNA FISCHER [01:12:43] We have to tell everyone this.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:12:44] Of course you tell.

JENNA FISCHER [01:12:46] No, you tell. You watched it.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:12:47] OK. Well, walking into the parking lot. The documentary camera crew catches the two guys from Vance Refrigeration played by our writers, Lee and Gene.

JENNA FISCHER [01:12:58] Gino and Leo, their character names.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:13:01] That's right. They're walking in. It's just a spy shot from the back. And I think it's Gene is smoking a joint. He just flicks it into the parking lot.

JENNA FISCHER [01:13:09] That's whose joint it was.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:13:11] Vance Refrigeration.

JENNA FISCHER [01:13:12] Yeah.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:13:12] No one at Dunder Mifflin.

JENNA FISCHER [01:13:14] There you go.

ANGELA KINSEY [01:13:15] There you go.
