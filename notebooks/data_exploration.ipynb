He said, you know, in England, you can be really, really bad at your job for a long time and you never get fired. He was like, in America that's going to frustrate people. So my one piece of advice is that Michael can be a buffoon, he can be silly, he can be irritating. But you should, I suggest, he said, that you show glimpses of him actually being a good salesperson. And we do that throughout the show. You see in future episodes that he is actually good at sales. And he said that's going to be an important piece of the puzzle. And Stephen Merchant said, my piece of advice would be to learn a little bit more into the Jim and Pam relationship. He said--\n",

Then he came up to me and was like, half of that. And I said, okay. So I said, somebody's gonna get fired. I bet it'll be me. And he goes, half of that. And I go, oh my God! I'm gonna get fired because I'm like a sketch and improv comedy actor and clearly I'm too broad.

All about where the boom microphone was. Rainn as Dwight was very distracted by the boom. And he was saying I really need you to move that. And Ken says we can put it in your blind spot.

Because we talked about in the pilot that this was based on a British television show of the same name and the pilot episode was an adaptation of their script. This was not. After the pilot of our show, we started writing original storylines for our version of the show.\n",

And then the psychologist would determine whether they could recommend you for the job or not.\n",
      "\n",

      "JENNA: But can you imagine how suspenseful it was for me to be typing out that information. I was like, what are they... That's what I was doing when I was twenty five. When BJ Novak was twenty five years old, he was writing this television show. And this was his first job writing for a show. And his first script was Diversity Day. What the hell is going on?\n",

      "JENNA: Right? I know. And then they had Larry Wilmore and Lester Lewis who were consulting. This room full of writers broke down the plots and storylines of the five remaining episodes of season one. And they did this as a group. So they created outlines for each of these episodes and then a different writer got assigned a different outline and he got assigned Diversity Day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "JENNA: Yes. And you had to fill in the dialogue and fiferent story points. You know, you do a good amount of writing for your episode. But the idea of the episode comes from the group collective.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "JENNA: I enjoy digesting your notecards. Digests this first though. People want to know where did the idea for this episode come from. This episode was based on the real life experience of our writers assistant, Tom. So when they were in that writers room they throw out ideas for episodes and Tom told this story about how when he was in college, he took a class and in the class they did this exercise where they had to put notecards on their heads with different ethnicities and then they had to go around and regard one another as that ethnicity.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "JENNA: Absolutely perfect. A lot of people ask why were so many writers actors on the show. And that was Greg Daniels. Greg believed that it would be a great idea for writers to have the experience of acting because it would give them a bigger appreciation of what an actor does. Which I have to say is so brilliant and I think there are a lot of directors that I know go take acting classes just so they can better speak to actors and better understand actors and it completely worked on our show that the workers were immersed with us because they really go to not just understand our jobs but they got to see us being our characters first hand. They got to see our improvisations that they would never see if they were just stuck up in the writers rooms. And all of that ended up becoming a part of the show.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ANGELA: I think it was so great. It made us a cohesive show between the two departments, the writers and actors. This creative partnership. It always felt like a partnership to me. And made me feel safe like I could try things. But BJ and Mindy were really great performers, they were crossovers. Paul was not a performer. Paul had only just been a writer. So I know this was like a huge step out of his comfort zone.\n",

      "\n",
      "JENNA: You did such a good job. Now, I have done films and have done things where someone is on the other line. For example, in season nine when Pam breaks down crying at her desk, they figured out a way to wire in John Krasinski live so I could hear him in my ear. So there are times when there's a really emotional scene or a scene that really requires you to speak to the other actor. But ninety percent of the time you are just pretending someone is there.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "JENNA: And after that scene, Jim finds out that he's lost the sale. That Dwight stole the sale that is twenty five percent of his income. He goes back into the conference room where Michael is wrapping things up and everyone is bored to tears and that is when Pam falls asleep on Jim's shoulder. And we filmed that about, oh my goodness, like fifteen sixteen times, that scene. Because this was our Jim Pam moment of the episode. This was it. And they really wanted to get these little Jim Pam moments just perfectly. I looked up this scene in the script and there is a piece of stage direction that BJ Novak wrote that I want to read for you because I think it is so perfect. He wrote, Jim reacts to Pam falling asleep on him like a butterfly has landed on his shoulder.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ANGELA: Oh that is so sweet. Well, I wrote, you know, this is equally as insightful, you guys. I wrote on my note card, what a great Jam moment at the end and Jenna's skin looks flawless.\n",

      "JENNA: Alright so you remember earlier in the episode when Mr. Brown starts his training, he explains what a hero is and it's an acronym. And then Dwight explains what he thinks a hero is. Well after all that happened, there was this scene where Michael stands up and creates his own acronym for sensitivity. And his words are inclusion, new attitude, color blidn, expectations, sharing, and tolerance. And while he's saying these words, Dwight is writing them on a white board. And I look at the white board and I say, Michael, that spells incest. And then Steve tap dances and says, but it still works because incest is bad abnd discrimination is bad. But also incest is something that happens in your family and the world is our family. Like it's just a crazy ramble.\n",

I just remember shooting that scene and every time I had to raise my hand and very matter of factly point out that it spells incest, then there was a silence in the room as everyone took it in. And I was sad that went on the cutting room floor.\n",

Now, I know out there, people think that when you go to these parties, you become friends with people, but you really don't, like, you kind of hobnob. You maybe take a picture and then you never see them again and you sort of stick with the people you already knew.\n",

He got my phone number from you and was like, \"Can you tell me any stories about Jenna that you know from the years?\" And I was supposed to give a speech at your wedding. I was going to give a toast. You asked me to give a toast. And I sort of told Jeff some of my stories about you that I was going to have on my toast.\n",

      "\n",
      "ANGELA [00:07:48] Yes. Dang it, Probsty. I told you. And I call him Probsty. I made up a nickname for him. I'm sure he loved it.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "JENNA [00:07:55] All right. Next fast fact. The original cut of this episode came in at 40 minutes, which is way too long because for a show to air on television on network TV, it can only be 20 minutes and 30 seconds. Because you make room for the commercials.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ANGELA [00:08:13] Hey, network TV people. I just have a little tip for you. And I know you want me to to weigh in on things. Change up your format.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "JENNA [00:08:20] I know, because they had to cut out like half of what they wanted to cut. And Greg considered splitting this into two episodes.\n",

      "\n",
      "JENNA [00:08:34] Well, I will tell you on the Season 1 DVD, they have the deleted scene from this episode. And they are delightful. I watched them and most of what was cut out were really funny kind of general office life scenes. So there was this great bit between Jim and Dwight where Dwight is changing his password, where he's going on and on about how his password on his computer is the best. And Jim keeps guessing it. He's like, \"Is it Frodo?\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "JENNA [00:09:08] And then there's another really great one of Dwight just cleaning out the fridge in the break room and he throws away Jim's tuna sandwich. There was also a really great scene that when I was watching this deleted scene, I remembered shooting it. And it was so funny of Michael coaching Pam on how to answer the phone with a smile. He said that she sounded really gloomy. And he then stands by her desk and waits for the phone to ring. And there's just these long pauses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ANGELA [00:09:36] Awkward pauses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "JENNA [00:09:37] And then he does this funny thing where he puts his hands in front of his face and he says, \"Tell me if I'm smiling or not.\".\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ANGELA [00:09:44] Oh my lord.\n",

      "JENNA [00:09:46] He's like, \"Dunder Mifflin, this is Michael\". And she's like, \"Yes. You're smiling.\" And then he's like, \"Dunder Mifflin, this is Michael.\" And I'm like, \"Not smiling.\" And he's like, \"You hear the difference?\" And then I have this line where I'm like, \"That's a really great example. Thank you.\" But so there is a place if you're interested. The Season 1 DVD has all of these deleted scenes on it. And, you know, by the way, the reason Greg couldn't split this up into two episodes, he thought of doing one episode that was just about throwing the birthday party and one episode that was just about the alliance, the big prank. And then you could have filled it out with some of these general office life scenes. The problem was at the end of the episode, we all have birthday hats on.\n",

It's like that famous line that people say, like this whole meeting could have been one email. That's what it is. You know, I have to point out my hairstyle in this party planning committee scene, because that hairstyle was bonkers crazy. It was like, I don't know, we took two pieces and we twisted it back to the back of my head. And then we did a low ponytail that connected it. And I had so many rubber bands and pins holding it. And then I had one piece that kept flopping out and it drove me crazy. And by the end of the episode, I was like, I don't ever want this. I can't do this again. I can't have this hairstyle again.

You can't tell anyone.\" Jim's like, \"Of course not.\" And then Jim immediately comes up to the reception desk and tells me that he's formed an alliance with Dwight. And you see Dwight hovering in the background, listening in. And he wants to get Jim away from me. So he has this line where he's like, \"Jim, can I talk to you about the the paper products?\" So I listen to the DVD commentary of this. And I guess in that scene, they have a bunch of takes where Rainn, every time, he would change the end of the line.

      "ANGELA [00:31:00] I'll tell you what. Steve Carell is better than anyone at letting an emotion wash across his face. And you watch that emotion of like, oh crap, just like, oh what did I do, like, go across his face and I feel like we see this again in Fun Run because he like signs up to do so many miles and he doesn't realize--.\n",

And they're standing next to a car. And it's Phyllis's car. And Rainn as Dwight keeps kicking the car. And Phyllis, she didn't care for it. She was very nervous about it. And I guess at some point she went up to Rainn and said, listen, it's totally fine if you kick my car, but don't kick the car or the hubcap. Just the tire.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "JENNA [00:32:51] A very, very big element of this episode is the point where Dwight ends up in a box in the warehouse and more than any other question, when I put this out to fans for questions, the most questions that we got, the most frequently asked questions were about this box. How long was Rainn in the box? How many takes did we do? How many boxes did we use? There is a scene where Pam is on the phone doing a fake phone call and the box kind of tips over. And I laugh and run off\n",

      "JENNA [00:33:56] I know. I think because I remember shooting that scene and I remember it was very technical. So it was happening over my shoulder. Stuff was happening over my shoulder. But there was a way where they wanted me to break at a certain moment. So it was kind of technical.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "JENNA [00:34:18] Yes, exactly. So, I remember shooting at a number of times and I remember thinking to myself, gosh, does this even look real? Like it's a really... there are two things that I think are really hard to do when you're acting. One of them is cry. But I think people would expect that. But the other is to laugh convincingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ANGELA [00:34:36] Yes. You know who has the best fake laugh is Steve Carell. Steve Carell can do this fake laugh that is the most honest, genuine laugh. And every time he would do it, I would start to laugh. Even though I knew it was a fake laugh, it was so contagious. He is the best at it. I find it's easier to cry than to fake laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "JENNA [00:34:59] Fake laughing is very difficult. It is. The reason I think that I didn't really break is because I remember having anxiety over whether or not anyone was going to buy it.\n",

      "\n",
      "JENNA [00:35:16] Yes. When Rainn pops out of the box at the end, Darryl is down there. Now he is not going to have a big scene. We're not going to hear him speak until the next episode, which is Basketball.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ANGELA [00:35:28] Yes, but that is the first time we see Darryl. So I was very excited. And look, my note card came in handy.\n",

      "\n",
      "ANGELA [00:35:48] Yeah. That is one of the things and I know we say it over and over and we will for the life of this podcast. But one of the things I love about what Greg Daniels did is he starts in the middle. He doesn't spoon feed you information. Just the way they designed the show, you played catch up as an audience member. You're just like a day in the life and you're right in the middle. And I love that.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "JENNA [00:36:33] So most of the box acting was done by Phil Shea, of course, except for the end where Rainn busts out. So in that scene where I'm cracking up. Phil Shea was in the box.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "JENNA [00:37:34] So we opened up questions to the fans and overwhelmingly the thing people wanted to know about was the box that Rainn gets in the warehouse. So they wanted to know how long he was in the box. Everything about the box. But Phil, I know you were in the box.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "ANGELA [00:38:01] Phil, you did all of that in the box? You were the scoocher and the tumbler and all that?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "PHIL [00:38:05] I was. Apparently Mr. Zbornak, our line producer didn't think we had enough money to hire a stunt guy. So he assigned me to be in the box. And I remember I had to go out and buy my own elbow pads and knee pads. And I had a loose walkie talkie in there with me with Liz Ryan, the first AD, shouting along with Brian Gordon, who was our director for that episode. I remember like it was yesterday.\n",

      "\n",
      "JENNA [00:38:31] So, Phil, can you take me through it from the beginning? You get a script and it says this character has to be in a box. So what do you do? Because you're in charge of getting the box as the prop master. So what or where do you start?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "PHIL [00:38:44] On that particular prop, I guess I sought out Greg Daniels and I said, do you see Rainn sitting down squatting in the box or is he kneeling down on his hands and knees? And he said kneeling on his hands and knees.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "PHIL [00:39:02] Yeah, yeah. Rainn is I think six one or six two and I'm six one if I blow dry my hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ANGELA [00:39:07] You do have great hair. You guys should know. Phil has an amazing head of hair.\n",

      "JENNA [00:39:12] He really does. This is true.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "PHIL [00:39:14] I lease it. It's a Hollywood fake hairdo. I tracked Rainn down and I asked him to get on his hands and knees. I was measurer for this box.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "JENNA [00:39:23] Wait, you made Rainn get on his hands and knees? And you measured him to know how big he was?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "PHIL [00:39:28] That was season one, Rainn was willing to do anything. Then I went to a couple Box Cities around Southern California. No one had a box close to that. So then I went on to the Internet and I looked at box manufacturers in Southern California. I found a company in San Diego named Kent Landsberg. And you have to understand, as prop people, we have a very short production time and lead time to get all these props. So I called this Kent Landsberg paper company and asked to speak to the manager. And in a much more frenetic and hyper voice, I said, look, you've got to help me out. I have to have a custom box made. I probably need a hundred of them and they need to be this dimension.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ANGELA [00:40:08] And San Diego's like three hours away, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "JENNA [00:40:11] Well, and also, that's such a good point. You didn't need one box. You need a hundred boxes because you didn't know how many takes we were gonna do. And Brian Gordon, the director of this episode, ended up being notorious for many, many tons of takes. So you were right to cover your bases and get one hundred.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "PHIL [00:40:29] Right. And we shot that scene in the Dunder Mifflin warehouse. We wanted to have some boxes on the shelves.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "JENNA [00:40:39] Oh right. Ones that he didn't burst out of.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "PHIL [00:40:40] Right. It wasn't a prop box. It just appeared out of nowhere. So we had to give some legitimacy to where it originated from.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "JENNA [00:40:47] Look at all the details.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ANGELA [00:40:49] So how do you do it? This guy said he would do it, no problem. And then how do you get them?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "PHIL [00:40:54] Well, I talk to him. He said the lead time is usually a month and a half. I said we have four days. I said I need the boxes in four days. And I said it was for a TV show. I said for The Office. This is a remake of the British version.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "JENNA [00:41:05] And he probably said, I'm sorry, I'm a huge fan of the British version.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ANGELA [00:41:09] I've never heard of your show.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "PHIL [00:41:12] It's like you guys were listening to this one. That's exactly what he said. No. No. He said he would be glad to make an exception for a TV show. So he made it happen. We got the boxes delivered to Culver City, which is where we shot that episode in our first season. And then they put the graphics on the box and we had it back two days before we were filming. So we had it all done and Rainn sat in the box fine. And then it was just about coordinating where the holes would be inserted. But I knew, I'm inside that box with Dwight's Swiss Army knife and it was a great scene. I mean, I remember we shot that down and I think it was a Friday night we shot that scene. But it was it was fun. Everybody was laughing. The crew was always laughing on that show. And it was a great scene. Fans love it so much.\n",

      "PHIL [00:41:55] I'm looking at a picture that I can email you that Michael Gallagher gave me. I'm going to send you a picture as soon as we hang up of me getting ready to tape up the first box. I don't know if you have the ability to put the picture on the podcast, but I'm going to take a picture of it.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "JENNA [00:42:43] We did. We left you in the box and we pretended like we were still filming. And then you just were there for so long.\n",

So the first thing I remember was that somehow in the scene when Jim and I are giggling about our accomplishment, we had to find a way to hold hands. That there had to be an organic way where his arm is around me. There had to be something because Roy has walked in the door before and seen Jim standing at reception talking to me.

He breaks that barrier. He comes around the desk. He puts his arm on me. We end up kind of holding hands and giggling. And I remember us really struggling to make sure that it looked real and organic and not staged. We didn't want to do something so out of the ordinary that you would be expecting something to happen. And I think we accomplished it. And then when he burst in the door, there were a couple of takes where he pushed Jim up against a wall where he like really got more physical with Jim. And so we shot all these different versions so that we could get it just right.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ANGELA [00:49:43] Right. And the version they went with is the best. I think if Roy had gotten too physical there, it just would have taken us all out of it. Because we'd be like, whoa! But I think just how ticked off he was... and then I thought John was brilliant in that moment. He was so believable when he was like, I don't even know how to explain this because he realizes how ridiculous how their whole day has been. And how do you explain what they've been doing? And they're so busted, though. Like it just is a moment that made me totally cringe.\n",

Well, this is the thing you guys are gonna hear a lot as we do this podcast is this show spanned 10 years of our lives and so much life happens in those ten years. And we really do have all these special memories of our own lives mixed in with what was happening on The Office. And I feel like it shows because we all became so invested in each other's lives that we are our own misfit family. Like the people that play the characters on The Office in real life have a lot of shared life moments and memories. And I think it just makes the show special to me. So when I watch it, I remember things, too. And it's just so... I love that you shared that. Yay. OK. That was The Alliance, everyone.\n",
