Oh, I will never forget the morning. On Monday mornings, Steve would come out of his office, out of Michael Scott's office between scenes, he would walk over to Jenna and I and we would talk about our weekends. And one Monday morning, he walked over and he was like, ladies, guess what I did this weekend. And we're like what? And he's like I went to Target. He would talk to use about Target. And he told us about his Target run. It was really, really sweet. You know recently, I was in a Michaels purchasing some supplies for a crafting job. And the checkout guy said, oh myÃ‚  gosh, now this is getting crazy. This morning, Oscar Nunez came in here. Then Steve Carrell and now you? What do you all live here? We love crafting. We love crafting.\",\n",

And so Phyllis went from being a casting associate, which she had done for years with Allison Jones the casting director to having a part in this pilot. And I think because we all thought the show was going nowhere, it was fine. And after the pilot was over, she went back to being a casting associate. She went right back to work. Phyllis has a great story that she tells that the way she found out she got Phyllis is that she got sides and they said Phyllis. So there was a character and they named it Phyllis. And Ken was like, that's you. You're Phyllis. And she was like what? We wrote a part for you. Based on the numerous readings with actors.\",\n",

But then he goes *drum noise* and then in season three, I karaoke Little Drummer Boy and Dwight joins in and sings with me. Now that story is that I was very nervous to sing. I don\\'t like singing in front of people. And Rainn as Dwight just kinda jumped in and supported me so I wasn\\'t up there alone. And he kneeled down and he held the microphone for me. And I\\'m just like, oh my God. I mean, what? That\\'s weird. That\\'s crazy. I feel like that has to be a coincidence. I think it\\'s a coincidence but so many fans say to me what amazing synergy it is that Dwight is singing Little Drummer Boy in the pilot. And then in season three, I sing it to him. Now, did a writer remember that? Was that something that or was that in the subconscious of the show? I don\\'t know.',\n",

And he says I don't have a blind spot, I've been trained, so that's especially distracting for me. You need to understand that I'm highly trained. And it's just this little non-presentational conversation between Dwight and the documentarian about how to be micÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d. I just wanna say one thing. So many great things were established in the pilot that you go to see for years to come. Of course, one of the big ones is the Jim vs Dwight. Their battle and the pranks that Jim is gonna do on Dwight. And I love that it started out so simply with Dwight pushing all of Jim's papers back to his desk and then Jim making his pencil wall.

He wants to be the funny guy.Ã‚ So he's gonna show off for Ryan the temp. He's gonna fake fire Pam. And of course it goes horribly wrong and she ends up in tears. And we shot that scene probably thirty times. Wow. And at the beginning of the scene, you can see everyone in the background getting ready to leave for the day. And all those people had to wait for hours. They would have to start in the background and we would do this whole scene. Oh I know, Jenna. You know. I was there. I had to grab my jacket, my coat, my purse. Put them down. My coat and my purse. I think of any scene in the entire history of The Office, this is the one that I've done the most because we did about thirty takes of it that day but it was also my audition scene. This was one of my audition scenes so I auditioned for months for this role.Ã‚ I did that scene one time when I auditioned for the role of Pam and I didn't get it!\",\n",

The summary is: exhausted from making their own deliveries, the Michael Scott Paper Company is steadily gaining clients due to their very low prices, but it turns out they're going broke in the process. Yeah. Meanwhile, Dunder Mifflin is desperate to negotiate a buyout because they have lost several important clients to Michael Scott Paper Company. But Michael has other ideas. I was so impressed and also scared by all of Michael's tactics. When he gets out of the elevator and he's like doubled over and he's like, I'm really afraid I'm going to say we're broke. I'm going to be able to do it.\",\n",

And the week before you direct an episode, the director normally preps the episode, and that sort of involves meeting with each of the different department heads to make decisions about the locations, about the props, the wardrobe, camera setups.

But this brings on some real Phyllis sass. Yeah. She's like, perhaps if you had returned Michael's phone calls, this would have never happened. What you need to know about Phyllis is that she's already pissed off because of the expense reports. So she is not mincing her words. And then David is going to invite Jim to join him and Charles in the conference room. And Charles is like, Hold up. Dwight's been my guy. Jim, not living up to his potential.

They get in the elevator, the doors open on the next floor and he's like, I don't got it. I, I'm not. I can't do it. I loved it so much. It made me laugh out loud. That's a whole fakey elevator, as everyone knows. We got in the elevator. The guy with the pulleys pulled the rope, pulled the doors, and then we relocated to a completely different building, to the Dunder Mifflin elevator. And we got out, and it is seamless. It looks so good. Oh, that was funny. And then we walk in and Michael has his line that I have seen quoted so many times where he says, Well, well, well, how the turntables... OK, I had to know how that was scripted. So I went to the shooting draft and that line is not in the script. Oh my gosh, we got a fan question about that. Yeah, I don't know if it was pitched on the fly. You know how sometimes writers would have some pitches? Or have Steve improvised it? I don't know. But in the script, this is what it said.

It occurred to us that while most luxury cars were too big, most sport coupes were too small. We wanted the Sebring to be, well, just right.
